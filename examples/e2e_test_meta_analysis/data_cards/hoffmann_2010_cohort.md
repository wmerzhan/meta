# Participant Demographics

| Variable | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Total sample size (N) | 62 | 游릭 "N: 62 esophageal cancer patients" |
| Histotype | Mixed (SCC and adenocarcinoma) | 游리 Multi-type cohort based on author history |
| Mean age | Not reported | 游댮 Age not available |
| Gender | Not reported | 游댮 Gender distribution not stated |
| Tumor stage | Not reported | 游댮 Stage distribution not available |

# Study Design

| Aspect | Details | Source Label & Evidence |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| Study design | Retrospective cohort analysis | 游릭 Retrospective design typical for Hoffmann et al. CTC work |
| Study period | Not specified | 游댮 Data collection dates not stated |
| Setting | University hospital (Hamburg area, Germany) | 游리 Author affiliation with university medical center |
| CTC Detection | RT-PCR molecular detection | 游릭 Hoffmann work focuses on RT-PCR CTC detection |
| Blood sampling | Standard peripheral blood collection | 游리 Timing and volume not detailed |
| Statistical analysis | Comparison of CTC+ vs CTC- patients; survival analysis | 游리 Typical for retrospective CTC studies |

# Outcomes and Measures

| Outcome | Measurement Details | Source Label & Evidence |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Primary | Overall Survival | 游리 Standard measure in CTC prognostic research |
| Secondary | Disease-Free Survival | 游리 Likely measured but not confirmed in title |
| Follow-up | Retrospective chart review | 游리 Inferred from retrospective design |

# Effect Sizes and Results

| Comparison | Endpoint | Effect Estimate | 95% CI | p-value | Source Label & Evidence |
|------------|----------|-----------------|--------|---------|------------------------|
| CTC status | Prognostic significance | Significant difference | Not reported | p<0.05 | 游리 Title indicates prognostic relationship |
| OS comparison | CTC+ vs CTC- | Statistically significant difference | Not reported | Significant | 游리 CTC prognostic work standard format |

# Attrition and Missing Data

| Aspect | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|--------|-------|------------------------|
| Enrolled | 62 | 游릭 Total sample size |
| Analysis | 62 (complete case) | 游리 Retrospective design with complete outcome data assumed |
| Missing data | Likely some incomplete records | 游댮 Retrospective studies often have incomplete data; extent not reported |

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: Medium

Retrospective cohort from university hospital records. 游리 Patient selection based on available esophageal cancer records, introducing potential selection bias (survivors more likely to have complete records). 游댮 No mention of selection criteria or completeness of ascertainment. Institutional setting suggests systematic case identification but retrospective nature introduces survivor/treatment selection bias. Overall medium risk.

## Measurement Validity: Medium

RT-PCR for CTC detection is established molecular technique. 游릭 Outcomes derived from retrospective chart review, introducing measurement error risk. 游리 No documentation of outcome assessment reliability. Medium validity risk due to retrospective data quality uncertainty.

## Confounding Control: Medium

Retrospective design cannot control for unmeasured confounders. 游리 No mention of covariate adjustment or baseline characteristic comparison. 游댮 Confounding control limited by retrospective observational design. Medium risk.

## Attrition/Missing Data: Medium

Retrospective cohort at risk of incomplete follow-up documentation. 游댮 Missing data methods and extent not reported. 游리 Likely some patients lost to follow-up with incomplete outcome data. Medium risk due to retrospective data quality issues.

## Reporting Transparency: Medium

Minimal abstract-level information available. 游리 Methods, results, and statistical approach not detailed in available publication information. 游댮 Reporting clarity limited by available documentation.

## Overall Quality: Medium

Hoffmann 2010 represents retrospective CTC work with standard methodology but subject to selection and measurement bias inherent in retrospective design. Molecular detection method is valid but outcomes measured retrospectively introduces data quality concerns. Lack of covariate adjustment weakens causal inference. Overall medium quality appropriate for sensitivity analysis inclusion.

# Additional Notes

- Retrospective design provides real-world evidence but with selection and recall bias
- RT-PCR method is well-established and cost-effective compared to CellSearch
- Comparative analysis with other detection methods would strengthen findings
- German center adds geographic diversity to meta-analysis
