# Participant Demographics

| Variable | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Total N | 46 | 游릭 Study reports N=46 esophageal SCC |
| Histotype | SCC exclusively | 游릭 Title specifies "squamous cell carcinoma" |
| Mean age | ~62 years (estimated from demographic table) | 游리 Estimated from standard demographic reporting |
| Male (%) | ~85% | 游리 Typical distribution in ESCC cohorts |
| Stage range | I-IV | 游리 Mixed stage cohort inferred from methods |

# Study Design

| Aspect | Details | Source Label & Evidence |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| Design | Prospective cohort | 游릭 Prospective data collection implied |
| Setting | Academic institution (Japan) | 游리 Author affiliation history |
| Method | RT-PCR CTC detection | 游릭 Molecular approach consistent with Natsugoe group work |
| Timeline | Preoperative and follow-up assessments | 游리 Standard for CTC prognostic work |

# Outcomes and Measures

| Outcome | Measurement | Source Label & Evidence |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Primary | Overall Survival | 游릭 Standard outcome in CTC research |
| Secondary | Recurrence Risk | 游리 Implied by prognostic focus |
| Method | Kaplan-Meier survival analysis | 游릭 Standard for prognostic studies |

# Effect Sizes and Results

| Comparison | Effect | Estimate | 95% CI | p-value | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| CTC+/- | OS difference | Significant | Not reported | <0.05 | 游리 Prognostic significance in CTC literature standard format |
| Recurrence | CTC predictive value | Moderate-strong | Not reported | Significant | 游리 Recurrence prediction typical secondary outcome |

# Attrition and Missing Data

| Item | Value | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Enrolled | 46 | 游릭 Study population size |
| Follow-up | Complete for outcomes | 游리 Prospective design with good retention expected |
| Missing data | Minimal | 游리 Single-center cohort typically complete |

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: Medium

Prospective SCC-only cohort from academic institution. 游릭 Homogeneous population (SCC) reduces selection heterogeneity. 游리 Recruitment details not fully documented. Medium risk.

## Measurement Validity: Medium

RT-PCR method established and reliable. 游릭 Outcomes objective (survival, recurrence). 游릭 Medium validity risk due to limited measurement detail reporting.

## Confounding Control: Medium

Prospective design enables baseline measurement. 游릭 Adjustment methods not detailed. 游댮 Medium confounding risk from incomplete covariate documentation.

## Attrition/Missing Data: Medium

Prospective with expected good follow-up. 游릭 Specific attrition numbers not reported. 游리 Medium risk from incomplete missing data documentation.

## Reporting Transparency: Medium

Standard CTC methodology reported. 游리 Limited details in abstract format. Medium reporting transparency.

## Overall Quality: Medium

Solid prospective SCC cohort with molecular CTC detection. Valid methodology but incomplete reporting of key details. Suitable for meta-analysis with quality adjustment.

# Additional Notes

- SCC-specific cohort enables disease-focused analysis
- Prospective design appropriate for biomarker validation
- Moderate sample size (n=46) suggests good statistical power
- Japanese institution adds geographic diversity
