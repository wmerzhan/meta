# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: Medium

This prospective cohort study had appropriately defined inclusion/exclusion criteria (histologically confirmed ESCC, candidates for surgical resection) and clear participant flow from recruitment through surgery (p. Methods). ðŸŸ¢ Recruitment at single institution from 2000-2002 but response rate/recruitment details not fully specified ðŸŸ¡ (no mention of how many eligible patients approached). The sampling is representative of surgical ESCC patients at Kagoshima University but lacks detail on recruitment procedures, timeline, and response rates. ðŸŸ¡ Overall, selection bias risk is moderateâ€”methodology appears sound but incomplete reporting prevents full risk assessment.

## Measurement Validity: Medium

CTC detection used RT-PCR targeting CEA mRNA, a well-established molecular technique. ðŸŸ¢ Method clearly described (7.5 mL blood samples, CEA-specific primers, GAPDH internal control, p. Methods). ðŸŸ¢ However, sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR method not reported; no validation against alternative detection methods (e.g., immunocytochemistry). ðŸ”´ Reliability (inter-assay reproducibility) of RT-PCR not addressed. ðŸ”´ Outcome measures (OS, DFS) are objective and standardized (Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests), reducing measurement bias. ðŸŸ¢ Blinding noted for pathologists but not for laboratory technicians. ðŸŸ¡ Overall measurement validity is moderateâ€”technical soundness of CTC detection present but lacking validation/reliability data.

## Confounding Control: Medium

This was not a randomized trial; CTC status was determined after enrollment (observational cohort). ðŸŸ¡ Baseline characteristics compared between CTC+ and CTC- groups ðŸŸ¢ (age, gender, tumor stage reported). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression used to adjust for tumor stage ðŸŸ¢ (p. Statistical methods: "Adjusted for stage"). However, limited information on adjustment for other confounders (performance status, comorbidities, treatment type post-surgery) not clearly addressed. ðŸ”´ Proportional hazards assumption was tested (Schoenfeld residuals, p>0.05) ðŸŸ¢ but other regression assumptions not discussed. ðŸ”´ Overall, reasonable but incomplete confounding control.

## Attrition/Missing Data: Medium

Study had relatively low overall attrition (5/54 = 9.3%, below 10% threshold for low risk). ðŸŸ¢ However, attrition was differential and outcome-related: 3 patients lost due to metastasis progression (directly related to outcome), raising MCAR assumption concerns. ðŸ”´ Missing data methods documented (last-observation-carried-forward for 3, complete case for 2) ðŸŸ¢ but sensitivity analysis provided (results similar across approaches). ðŸŸ¢ No detailed analysis of baseline characteristics comparing completers vs. dropouts. ðŸŸ¡ Overall attrition risk is moderateâ€”acceptable rate but outcome-dependent mechanism weakly addressed.

## Reporting Transparency: Medium

Methods section clearly describes participant characteristics, CTC detection procedure (primer sequences, gel methods), and assessment timing. ðŸŸ¢ Statistical tests specified (chi-square, log-rank, Cox regression) with assumptions addressed. ðŸŸ¢ Primary and secondary outcomes reported completely; effect sizes and confidence intervals provided. ðŸŸ¢ However, some key details missing: (1) inter-assay reproducibility of RT-PCR not reported; (2) exact follow-up times/methods for detecting recurrence unclear ðŸ”´; (3) supplementary tables referenced but content not detailed. ðŸ”´ Funding and conflicts disclosed (JSPS grant, no conflicts). ðŸŸ¢ Overall, good but incomplete reporting of statistical and procedural details.

## Overall Quality: Medium

This prospective cohort study demonstrates solid methodology (prospective design, clear inclusion criteria, multivariate analysis, reasonable attrition <10%) but has notable limitations. Selection bias risk is moderate due to incomplete reporting of recruitment procedures. Measurement validity is moderateâ€”RT-PCR is sound but lacks validation/reliability documentation. Confounding control is reasonable (stage-adjusted analysis) but incomplete (other confounders not addressed). Attrition is acceptable but outcome-dependent, raising bias concerns. Reporting is generally transparent but missing some technical and procedural details. No single high-risk domain, but accumulation of medium-risk domains across all five categories justifies medium overall quality rating. Study provides valid prognostic evidence but should be interpreted with caution regarding generalizability and generalization across populations/settings.

# Additional Notes

**Study Characteristics:**
- This is a single-institution prospective cohort study with relatively small sample size (n=54) from a specific geographic region (Kagoshima, Japan)
- Focus on ESCC exclusively; findings may not generalize to adenocarcinoma
- RT-PCR molecular detection method is sensitive but less specific than immunocytochemistry approaches

**Prognostic Utility:**
- Strong survival difference favoring CTC-negative patients (OS 3yr: 65.7% vs 26.3%, DFS 3yr: 57.1% vs 10.5%)
- Adjusted HRs remain significant after stage adjustment, suggesting CTC adds independent prognostic information
- However, sensitivity/specificity and optimal CTC threshold not calculated (cohort study without validation set)

**Data Quality Observations:**
- Complete baseline characteristic reporting with disease stage quantification
- Multiple timepoint CTC measurements provide dynamic prognostic information (preop, postop day 1, 3-month)
- Survival follow-up adequate to 3 years with acceptable attrition handling
- Outcome-related missing data (metastases) slightly undermines confidence in MCAR assumption

**Clinical Relevance:**
- Results suggest preoperative CTC detection could identify high-risk patients for intensified treatment
- Postoperative CTC surge (35.2% â†’ 51.9%) suggests therapeutic relevance
- However, positive predictive value and clinical decision thresholds not established
