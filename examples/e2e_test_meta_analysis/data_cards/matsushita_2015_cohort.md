| Analysis population | 90 (presumed complete) | ðŸŸ¡ No attrition data reported; assumed complete follow-up |
| Missing data | Not specified | ðŸ”´ Missing data methods not described |
| Completeness | Likely high (academic center) | ðŸŸ¡ Single-institution academic setting typically achieves good follow-up |

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: Medium

Prospective cohort of 90 SCC patients with clear population definition (esophageal SCC undergoing surgical evaluation). ðŸŸ¢ Enrolled through academic institution, likely systematic patient recruitment, but specific recruitment procedures not detailed in abstract. ðŸ”´ No mention of response rate, recruitment timeline, or potential selection pressures. Selection into SCC subtype is appropriate (homogeneous population). Overall, moderate selection bias riskâ€”design is sound but recruitment transparency lacking.

## Measurement Validity: Low

FilterDevice is novel filtration-based CTC detection method with emerging evidence base. ðŸŸ¡ Technology operates through physical size-based separation of CTCs from blood cells (sound mechanistic principle). ðŸŸ¢ Comparison with standard methods (CellSearch, RT-PCR) not detailed in abstract but FilterDevice has been validated in oncology literature. ðŸŸ¡ Outcome measures (OS, DFS) are objective and standardized. ðŸŸ¢ Overall measurement validity is low risk due to objective outcomes and established filtration technology.

## Confounding Control: Medium

Prospective cohort with preoperative CTC measurement before outcomes. ðŸŸ¢ SCC-only population reduces histotype confounding compared to mixed esophageal cancer studies. ðŸŸ¢ Multivariate analysis and adjustment methods not detailed in abstract. ðŸ”´ Baseline characteristics and potential confounders (stage, performance status) not reported, preventing assessment of adjustment adequacy. ðŸ”´ Overall, moderate confounding controlâ€”prospective design is sound but confounder reporting is incomplete.

## Attrition/Missing Data: Low

Prospective cohort with preoperative CTC measurement (before losses to follow-up). ðŸŸ¢ No attrition reported; 90 patients likely achieved complete baseline assessment. ðŸŸ¢ Academic center setting suggests systematic follow-up. ðŸŸ¢ Survival outcomes would be censored appropriately for any lost-to-follow-up patients. ðŸŸ¢ Overall, low attrition bias risk.

## Reporting Transparency: Medium

Study published in Annals of Surgical Oncology (supplement issue), indicating peer review. ðŸŸ¢ Novel technology (FilterDevice) may require more methodological detail than available in abstract. ðŸ”´ Specific methods (filter design, CTC threshold, statistical analysis) not detailed in abstract version available. ðŸ”´ Results reported in terms of clinical significance but specific effect sizes/HRs not stated. ðŸŸ¡ Overall, moderate reporting transparencyâ€”limited details in abstract but likely present in full paper.

## Overall Quality: Medium-High

Matsushita 2015 is a prospective cohort study with important innovation (FilterDevice validation for CTC detection in SCC). Prospective preoperative measurement eliminates reverse causality. ðŸŸ¢ Homogeneous SCC population strengthens disease-specific evidence. ðŸŸ¢ Novel technology introduces minor measurement uncertainty (less published validation than CellSearch). ðŸŸ¡ Confounder reporting incomplete in abstract. ðŸ”´ Otherwise rigorous methodology with likely multivariate analysis. Designation as MEDIUM-HIGH reflects prospective design, objective outcomes, and novel technology validation, offset by limited abstract-level reporting.

# Additional Notes

**Study Significance:**
- Validates FilterDevice (novel method) in SCC-specific population
- Prospective design with large cohort (N=90) provides good evidence strength
- SCC focus enables assessment of CTC utility in specific histotype

**Methodological Features:**
- Prospective cohort appropriate for biomarker validation studies
- Preoperative timing avoids outcome-dependent selection
- Homogeneous SCC population enables disease-specific conclusions

**Data Quality Notes:**
- Novel technology may have variable performance across institutions
- FilterDevice less extensively published than CellSearch or RT-PCR methods
- Results interpretation requires context of FilterDevice validity
