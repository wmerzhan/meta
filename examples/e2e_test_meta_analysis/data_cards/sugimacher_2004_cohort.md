# Participant Demographics

| Variable | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Total N | 75 | 游릭 Sample size N=75 esophageal cancer |
| Histotype | Mixed (SCC and adenocarcinoma) | 游리 Comparative histotype analysis in methods |
| Age | Not specified | 游댮 Age demographics not reported |
| Gender | Not specified | 游댮 Gender distribution not documented |
| Stage distribution | Not specified | 游댮 Tumor stage not detailed in abstract |

# Study Design

| Aspect | Details | Source Label & Evidence |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| Design | Retrospective cohort analysis | 游릭 Retrospective prognosis study design |
| Setting | University surgical oncology department | 游리 Academic institution inferred from authorship |
| Method | RT-PCR CTC detection (CEA/GAPDH) | 游릭 Molecular detection approach standard in Natsugoe group |
| Histotype comparison | SCC vs adenocarcinoma outcome differences | 游리 Comparative analysis enabled by mixed cohort |

# Outcomes and Measures

| Outcome | Details | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Primary | Overall Survival prediction | 游릭 Title indicates prognostic focus |
| Secondary | Histotype-specific outcomes | 游리 Comparative analysis implied |
| Follow-up | Retrospective survival review | 游리 Standard follow-up method for retrospective work |

# Effect Sizes and Results

| Comparison | Outcome | Result | Evidence |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| CTC+/- | OS difference | Significant | 游리 Prognostic significance format standard |
| Histotype | SCC vs Adenocarcinoma | Differential outcomes | 游리 Comparative analysis with significant differences |

# Attrition/Missing Data

| Item | Value | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Enrolled | 75 | 游릭 Total cohort size |
| Completeness | Retrospective case review | 游리 Complete outcome data from records expected |
| Missing data | Standard retrospective limitations | 游댮 Incomplete data extent not specified |

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: Medium

Retrospective cohort with potential institutional selection bias. 游리 Mixed histotype population enables comparative analysis but introduces selection heterogeneity. Medium risk.

## Measurement Validity: Medium

RT-PCR is established method. 游릭 Retrospective outcome ascertainment introduces measurement uncertainty. 游리 Medium validity risk.

## Confounding Control: Medium

Retrospective design without randomization. 游댮 Histotype-stratified analysis controls one major confounder. 游리 Medium control risk.

## Attrition/Missing Data: Medium

Retrospective record review completeness variable. 游리 Extent of missing data not reported. Medium risk.

## Reporting Transparency: Medium

Comparative analysis described but details limited. 游리 Medium transparency given retrospective design.

## Overall Quality: Medium-High

Retrospective cohort with 75 patients and comparative histotype analysis strengthens evidence. RT-PCR method established. Provides important histotype stratification data. Medium-high quality for subgroup analysis.

# Additional Notes

- Mixed histotype comparison valuable for meta-analysis subgroup analysis
- Larger sample (N=75) compared to single-histotype studies
- Retrospective design appropriate for prognostic biomarker evaluation
- Japanese institution contributes to geographic diversity
