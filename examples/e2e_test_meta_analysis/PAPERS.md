## Quality Assessment Predictions

Based on methodology documentation:

| Paper | Quality Prediction | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Nakashima 2003 | MEDIUM | Complete data, moderate reporting detail |
| Reeh 2015 | HIGH | Multivariate models, complete tables, clear methods |
| Matsushita 2015 | MEDIUM-HIGH | Novel method, rigorous data, limited detail |
| Hoffmann 2010 | MEDIUM | Retrospective, adequate reporting |
| Honma 2006 | MEDIUM | Standard cohort design |
| Sugimacher 2004 | MEDIUM-HIGH | Comparative histotype analysis |
| Miyazono 2004 | MEDIUM | Multivariate focus, detailed stats |
| Arigami 2003 | MEDIUM | Clear objectives, adequate data |
| Karachaliou 2013 | MEDIUM | Multi-cancer analysis with subset focus |
| Tinhofer 2014 | MEDIUM | Specialized population (smallest N) |
| Arigami 2006 | MEDIUM-HIGH | Treatment response focus, detailed outcomes |
| Gao 2007 | MEDIUM-HIGH | Multi-marker, sophisticated analysis |
| Okamura 2009 | MEDIUM | Standard reporting |
| Yamashita 2012 | HIGH | CellSearch + immunofluorescence, comprehensive |

**Expected Quality Distribution:**
- HIGH: 3 papers (21%)
- MEDIUM-HIGH: 4 papers (29%)
- MEDIUM: 7 papers (50%)
- LOW: 0 papers (0%)

## Data Extraction Focus Areas

### Primary Data Points to Extract (All Papers)
1. **Sample characteristics:** N, age, gender, histotype
2. **CTC detection:** Method, cutoff value, positivity rate
3. **Outcomes:** OS, DFS, time-to-recurrence
4. **Results:** Effect estimates, p-values, confidence intervals
5. **Statistical analysis:** Test used, adjustment variables, assumptions

### Heterogeneity Drivers to Document
- **CTC Detection Method:** RT-PCR (molecular) vs. CellSearch/FilterDevice (immunocytochemistry/filtration-based)
- **Histotype:** Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) vs. Adenocarcinoma
- **Study Design:** Prospective vs. Retrospective
- **Sample Size:** Range from 28-100
- **Follow-up Duration:** Varies by study

## Notes for Extractors

- **Context Sensitivity:** All papers are from esophageal cancer literature; extraction should be domain-consistent
- **Timepoint Handling:** Several papers include multiple timepoints (baseline, post-treatment, follow-up); extract all reported timepoints
- **Missing Data:** Retrospective studies may have incomplete reporting; use üî¥ labeling liberally
- **Supplem Mater:** Some papers reference supplementary materials; note if inaccessible
- **Author Contact:** If critical data unclear, suggest author contact (document in üî¥ label)

---

## Submission Format

Each completed extraction should produce a markdown file:
- **Filename:** `{author}_{year}_{design}.md` (e.g., `nakashima_2003_cohort.md`)
- **Location:** `data_cards/` directory
- **Format:** YAML frontmatter + markdown tables (per Microscope v1.0 template)
