# Sample Papers for Microscope Testing

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

This directory contains (or references) the research papers used to test Microscope v1.0 in Story 1.6.

## Purpose

These sample papers serve multiple purposes:
- **Validation:** Test Microscope extraction accuracy across diverse study types
- **Documentation:** Demonstrate MAestro workflow with real examples
- **Training:** Help new users understand the extraction process
- **Benchmarking:** Establish baseline extraction times and labeling coverage

## Paper Selection Criteria

Papers were selected to represent diverse characteristics:

### Discipline Coverage (minimum 3)
- Medicine (clinical trials, interventions)
- Psychology (behavioral interventions, measures)
- Education (learning interventions, academic outcomes)
- Other: Public Health, Social Work, Nutrition

### Study Design Variety
- **Simple RCTs:** 8-10 pages, clear IMRAD structure, straightforward results
- **Complex RCTs:** >12 pages, multiple outcomes, subgroup analyses
- **Quasi-experimental/Observational:** Non-randomized designs
- **Meta-analyses/Reviews:** For testing exclusion workflow

### Complexity Dimensions
- **Word count:** 8,000-12,000 words (primary target), one 15,000+ words (stress test)
- **Reporting quality:** High (complete data), medium (typical), low (substantial missing data)
- **Statistical complexity:** Simple (t-tests, ANOVAs) to complex (mixed models, SEMs)
- **Table density:** Few tables vs. many detailed statistical tables

## Copyright Considerations

## Usage

To use these sample papers for learning:

1. **Review the data cards** in `examples/sample_meta_analysis/data_cards/` to see extraction outputs
2. **Obtain the source paper** (from this directory or via DOI)
3. **Compare** the paper to the data card to understand extraction decisions
4. **Practice** by extracting a paper yourself using Microscope prompt
5. **Compare** your extraction to the sample data card
