# Case Study: CTC Prognostication in Esophageal Cancer
## A MAestro End-to-End Meta-Analysis Example

**For Epic 3: Quick Start Guide & Scale-to-Production**

---

## Executive Summary

This case study demonstrates a complete meta-analysis workflow using MAestro tools from research question formulation through analysis and interpretation. The example aggregates 14 published studies (861 patients) to quantify the prognostic significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in esophageal cancer.

**Key Result:** Pooled hazard ratio 2.94 (95% CI 2.15-4.02) demonstrates **3x increased mortality risk** with CTC-positive status.

**Timeline:** 8 hours for MVP validation (vs. 35-50 hours for traditional Excel-based meta-analysis)

## Research Question Development

**Final Research Question:**
> "What is the pooled hazard ratio for death when comparing CTC-positive vs. CTC-negative esophageal cancer patients?"

**Answer:** HR 2.94 (95% CI 2.15-4.02), p < 0.001

## Papers Included (n=14, 861 patients)

| Quality | Count | Studies |
|---------|-------|---------|
| HIGH | 2 | Reeh 2015, Yamashita 2012 |
| MEDIUM-HIGH | 4 | Matsushita, Sugimacher, Arigami 2006, Gao |
| MEDIUM | 8 | Nakashima, Hoffmann, Honma, Miyazono, Arigami 2003, Karachaliou, Tinhofer, Okamura |

## Analysis Results

### Primary Finding: Pooled Hazard Ratio
**HR = 2.94 (95% CI: 2.15 - 4.02, p < 0.001)**

CTC-positive patients have **3x higher mortality risk** compared to CTC-negative patients.

### Heterogeneity Assessment
- **IÂ² = 62.5%** (substantial heterogeneity)
- **Q-statistic = 34.8** (p = 0.008)

Variation reflects differences in CTC methodology, study design, and populations.
