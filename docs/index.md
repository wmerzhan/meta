# Welcome to MAestro Documentation

**MAestro** (Meta-Analysis Extraction, Synthesis, and Transparency Research Orchestrator) is an open-source framework for AI-assisted systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

## What is MAestro?

MAestro revolutionizes meta-analysis research by providing:

- **📝 Structured Prompt Templates** - Proven workflows for data extraction, compilation, and analysis generation
- **🔍 AI-Assisted Data Extraction** - Leverage Claude Code to extract data from scientific papers with confidence labels
- **📊 Reproducible Pipelines** - Version-controlled prompts and transparent analysis generation
- **🔒 Local-First Approach** - All research data stays on your machine for privacy and security
- **🎓 Discipline-Specific Modules** - Quality checklists tailored to your research domain

## Project Phases

MAestro is developed in three phases:

### MVP Phase (Current)

The current release provides:

- ✅ Prompt templates for Microscope (data extraction), Compiler (dataset creation), and Oracle (analysis generation)
- ✅ File templates for data cards and research appendices
- ✅ Generic and RoB 2 quality checklists
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and best practices

### CROS Phase (Coming Soon)

Future releases will add:

- 🔨 Python CLI tools for automation and validation
- 📦 PyPI package distribution
- 🧪 Automated testing and quality assurance

### Extension Phase (Future)

Advanced features will include:

- 🎨 VS Code extension for enhanced IDE integration
- 🔗 Direct integration with Claude Code workflows
- 📈 Visual progress tracking and validation

## Why MAestro?

Traditional meta-analysis workflows are:

- ❌ **Time-consuming** - Manual data extraction from dozens or hundreds of papers
- ❌ **Error-prone** - Human mistakes in transcription and calculation
- ❌ **Opaque** - Analysis code buried in proprietary software
- ❌ **Hard to update** - Difficult to incorporate new studies or reanalyze

MAestro addresses these challenges by:

- ✅ **Accelerating extraction** - AI-assisted workflows reduce manual effort
- ✅ **Increasing accuracy** - Three-tier confidence labels (🟢/🟡/🔴) ensure quality
- ✅ **Ensuring transparency** - Version-controlled prompts and generated code
- ✅ **Enabling reproducibility** - Clear workflows from extraction to analysis
