# Story 1.2: Define Data Card Markdown Format Standard

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** researcher using MAestro,

2. Template includes markdown table structures for common data types (participant demographics, outcomes, effect sizes, confidence intervals)
3. Three-color labeling syntax documented and demonstrated in template (ðŸŸ¢ for direct quotes with page/section references, ðŸŸ¡ for computed values with calculation shown, ðŸ”´ for uncertain/missing with explanation)
4. Inline comments in template explain each section's purpose and usage guidelines
5. Example data card provided (`examples/sample_data_card.md`) showing completed extraction from a real or simulated paper
6. Documentation file (`docs/data-card-format.md`) explains format rationale, YAML field definitions, table conventions, and three-color labeling rules

## Dev Notes

### Project Context

**Story 1.2 builds on Story 1.1** by creating the **foundational data format** for MAestro. This story defines how extracted research data will be stored throughout the entire project lifecycle.

**Critical importance:** The data card format created in this story will be used by:
- **Story 1.4** - Microscope prompt will output this format
- **Epic 2** - Compiler will parse and aggregate this format
- **Epic 3** - Documentation validation will reference this format

### Data Card Architecture [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Pattern 2: Data Card Microservice Architecture**

> "Each research paper's extracted data lives in an independent markdown file with YAML frontmatter (metadata) and markdown tables (data). Files are atomic units that can be created, validated, versioned, and compiled independently."

**Key architectural principles:**
- **Atomic units**: Each data card is self-contained and independent
- **Git-compatible**: Plain text markdown enables version control
- **Human-readable**: Researchers can read and edit without special tools
- **Filesystem as primary data store**: No database required in MVP phase

### DataCard Model Definition [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Model 1: DataCard - Complete attribute specification:**

```yaml
# Required fields:
study_id: String          # Unique identifier
title: String             # Paper title
authors: List[String]     # Author list
year: Integer             # Publication year
extraction_date: DateTime # When extracted
extractor: String         # Who extracted
microscope_version: String # Microscope version used
claude_model: String      # Claude model version
screening_decision: Enum["include", "exclude"]
quality_scores: Dict[String, Any]
extracted_data: List[DataPoint]

# Optional fields:
doi: String              # Digital object identifier
```

**Model 2: DataPoint - Nested within DataCard:**

```yaml
variable_name: String
value: Any
source_label: Enum["ðŸŸ¢", "ðŸŸ¡", "ðŸ”´"]  # REQUIRED - Three-color system
evidence: String                      # REQUIRED - Page/section/calculation
```

**Relationships:**
- DataCard belongs to Project (via filesystem path)
- DataCard contains multiple DataPoints (nested structure)
- DataCard references PromptTemplate (Microscope version)

### Three-Color Source Labeling System [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Pattern 3: Core differentiator for academic credibility**

**Label definitions:**
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green**: Direct quote with page/section reference
  - Example: "Sample size n=42 (p. 7, Methods section)"
- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow**: Computed/inferred value with calculation shown
  - Example: "Mean age 35.2 years (calculated from reported median 34 and SD 8.5)"
- **ðŸ”´ Red**: Uncertain or missing with explanation
  - Example: "Control group size not reported; excluded from demographics analysis"

**Critical requirement:** Labels must propagate through Compiler to final dataset [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pattern-3]

**PRD Goal:** 90%+ uncertain data flagging [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pattern-3]

### Technology Stack Implications [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Parsing and validation technologies (CROS phase):**
- **PyYAML 6.0.1+**: Parse YAML frontmatter (use `safe_load` for security)
- **python-markdown 3.6+**: Extract markdown tables to structured data
- **Pydantic 2.6+**: Schema validation for data cards (type-safe models, clear validation errors)

**For MVP (this story):** No code implementation needed - only document the format that will later be parsed by these tools.

### File Locations and Naming

**Template location:** `templates/data_card.md` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Example location:** `examples/sample_data_card.md` [Per AC #5]

**Documentation location:** `docs/data-card-format.md` [Per AC #6]

**User data card storage** (document in format guide): `{project_root}/data_cards/{study_id}.md` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md - examples/sample_meta_analysis/data_cards/]

**Naming convention recommendation:** Use `{study_id}.md` format (e.g., `smith_2023_rct.md`, `jones_2024_cohort.md`)

### Design Considerations

**1. Balance between structure and flexibility:**
- Provide standard table structures for common data types
- Allow researchers to add custom tables for discipline-specific data
- Include guidance in comments about when to customize

**2. Git diff-friendly formatting:**
- Use consistent indentation in YAML
- Keep tables aligned for readability
- One data point per row where possible

**3. Manual editing support:**
- Include inline comments explaining each section
- Use clear, descriptive field names
- Provide examples within the template itself

**4. Forward compatibility with CROS:**
- Design format to be parseable by python-markdown + PyYAML
- Ensure schema can be validated by Pydantic
- Consider CSV compilation requirements (flat table structures)

### Common Data Types to Support

**Based on Meta-analysis research workflows, include table structures for:**

1. **Participant Demographics**: Sample size, age (mean/median/range), gender distribution, population characteristics
2. **Outcomes/Measures**: Outcome variables, measurement instruments, reliability statistics, time points
3. **Effect Sizes**: Effect size type (Cohen's d, odds ratio, correlation, etc.), point estimate, standard error, 95% CI
4. **Study Design**: Design type (RCT, cohort, etc.), intervention details, comparison groups, duration

### Edge Cases to Address in Documentation

**Missing data scenarios:**
- Data not reported in paper â†’ ðŸ”´ with explanation
- Data partially reported â†’ ðŸŸ¡ with inference explanation
- Data contradictory across paper sections â†’ ðŸ”´ with note about conflict

**Calculated values:**
- Always use ðŸŸ¡ label
- Show calculation: "Cohen's d = (M1 - M2) / SD_pooled = (5.2 - 4.1) / 1.8 = 0.61"
- Reference source data page numbers

**Qualitative data:**
- Direct quotes â†’ ðŸŸ¢ with page number
- Researcher interpretations â†’ ðŸŸ¡ with reasoning
- Ambiguous themes â†’ ðŸ”´ with uncertainty note

### Testing

**MVP Phase Testing Philosophy:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

For Story 1.2 (documentation and template creation):
- **No automated tests required** (testing begins in CROS Phase 1)
- **Manual validation checklist:**
  1. Verify template file is valid YAML + markdown (test parsing manually or with online validators)
  2. Check all DataCard model fields are included in template YAML section
  3. Verify all three color labels (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´) are documented with examples
  4. Review example data card for completeness and clarity
  5. Test example data card can be read and understood by non-technical user
  6. Verify documentation covers all required sections (rationale, field definitions, labeling rules)
  7. Check that validation checklist is comprehensive and usable by researchers
  8. Ensure template includes sufficient inline comments for self-service use

**Validation strategy for MVP:**
- Manual checklist (AC #7) serves as validation tool
- Human review replaces automated validation until CROS phase
- Validation checklist will be converted to automated Pydantic schema validation in CROS

### Cross-Platform Considerations

**Emoji compatibility:**
- Three-color labels use emojis (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´)
- Test visibility in: Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal.app, Linux terminals, VS Code, GitHub web interface
- Note in documentation if emoji rendering issues exist on certain platforms
- Consider providing text fallback guidance: "Green", "Yellow", "Red" in parentheses

**Line endings:**
- Markdown files should use LF (Unix) line endings for cross-platform Git compatibility
- Document in data-card-format.md or contributing guidelines

### Integration with Other Stories

**Story 1.3 (Generic Quality Checklist):**
- Data card template should include `quality_scores` section that will be populated using checklist from 1.3
- Example data card (Task 4) should wait for or coordinate with 1.3 to show realistic quality assessment

**Story 1.4 (Microscope Prompt):**
- Microscope will be instructed to output data in this format
- Template created here serves as specification for Microscope output

**Story 1.6 (Testing Microscope):**
- Will validate that Microscope actually produces valid data cards following this format
- Validation checklist from this story will be used in 1.6 testing

### Deliverables Summary

By end of this story, the following files should exist:

1. `templates/data_card.md` - Template with YAML schema, table structures, three-color labeling documentation
2. `examples/sample_data_card.md` - Complete example showing all features
3. `docs/data-card-format.md` - Comprehensive documentation explaining format
4. Manual validation checklist (in docs or as separate file)

All files should be committed to Git and ready for use in subsequent stories.

### Enhancement Recommendations

**Future Improvements** (non-blocking, for CROS phase consideration):

- [ ] **Emoji Platform Compatibility**: Add explicit text fallback recommendation in main docs
  - Current: Mentioned in Dev Notes (story lines 278-288) but not in format spec
  - Suggestion: Add "Text Fallback" subsection to docs/data-card-format.md three-color section
  - Priority: LOW - Emojis render correctly on major platforms

- [ ] **Line Ending Convention**: Document in format spec
  - Current: Mentioned in Dev Notes (LF/Unix preferred) but not in format spec
  - Suggestion: Add to "Format Validation" section in docs
  - Priority: LOW - Git handles this automatically in most cases

- [ ] **Character Encoding**: Explicitly state UTF-8 requirement
  - Current: Implied but not explicitly stated
  - Suggestion: Add to YAML Field Definitions or Format Conventions section
  - Priority: LOW - UTF-8 is default for modern systems

**Note:** These are very minor polish items. They do not impact MVP functionality or block story completion.
