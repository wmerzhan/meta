# Story 1.1: Initialize Repository and Project Structure

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** project maintainer,
**I want** a well-organized GitHub repository with clear folder structure and foundational documentation,
**so that** contributors can navigate the project easily and understand how to add prompts, modules, and examples.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository created with monorepo structure including `prompts/`, `modules/`, `templates/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, and `examples/` directories
2. README.md includes project overview, quick start placeholder, and links to documentation
3. LICENSE file added (MIT or Apache 2.0, decision documented in ARCHITECTURE.md or similar)
4. .gitignore configured to exclude common IDE files, OS files (.DS_Store), and temporary files
5. CONTRIBUTING.md outlines community contribution guidelines and peer review process for discipline modules
6. Initial GitHub Pages setup configured (even if minimal) to host documentation
7. Repository is publicly accessible on GitHub with appropriate topics/tags for discoverability
8. Initial commit created with foundational files (README, LICENSE, .gitignore, directory structure) establishing Git baseline *(PO Validation: Critical Issue #1)*
9. DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md created with consolidated environment setup instructions including: Poetry installation, Python 3.9+ version management, Claude Code CLI/Desktop setup, required tools and versions, cross-platform setup notes (Windows/macOS/Linux) *(PO Validation: Critical Issue #2)*

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
None - This is the first story in Epic 1.

### Project Structure Requirements

The repository follows a **monorepo structure** containing prompt templates, documentation, CROS tools (for later phases), and examples. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Complete directory structure to create:**
```

### Technology Stack for Documentation

**For DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md, include these technology requirements:**

- **Python:** 3.9+ (minimum for type hinting improvements; research community standard) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Poetry:** 1.8+ (dependency management and packaging) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Git:** 2.40+ (version control for data cards and prompts) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **MkDocs:** 1.5+ (static site generation for docs with Material theme) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Node.js:** 20.11.0 LTS (for future VS Code extension development) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **License:** MIT (maximum academic reuse; research community expectation) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration

**Documentation deployment method:** MkDocs with Material theme, deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages [Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#4-文档站点github-pages]

**Expected documentation URL:** https://maestro-meta.github.io (or similar based on repository name) [Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#4-文档站点github-pages]

**Deployment workflow (for future reference - not implemented in this story):**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
- name: Build and deploy
  run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```
[Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#4-文档站点github-pages]

### Coding Standards for Path Handling

**Rule 7: Paths must be cross-platform compatible** - Use pathlib for all path operations to ensure Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-7-路径必须跨平台兼容]

### Project Context

**Project Type:** Greenfield project - MVP phase is a collection of markdown prompt templates stored in Git repository. CROS phase will add Python CLI and VS Code Extension. [Source: docs/architecture/introduction.md#starter-template-or-existing-project]

**Architecture Approach:** Local-first application with NO traditional cloud infrastructure. All research data stored on user's local machine. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#cloud-infrastructure]

### Testing

**Testing Philosophy for MVP Phase:**
- **Verification priority over automation** - MVP phase uses manual testing and validation [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- **No automated tests required for MVP** - Testing coverage goals: MVP has N/A for unit test coverage, manual integration and E2E testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- **Test structure to be established in CROS phase** when Python CLI is developed [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**For this story (repository initialization):**
- Manual verification that all directories and files are created correctly
- Manual review of documentation files for completeness and accuracy
- Manual verification of GitHub repository settings and accessibility
- No automated test files needed at this stage

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**

| AC | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Repository created with monorepo structure | ✅ COMPLETE | All directories exist with correct structure |
| 2 | README.md with project overview | ✅ COMPLETE | README.md:1-107 - comprehensive content |
| 3 | LICENSE file added (MIT) | ✅ COMPLETE | LICENSE:1-22 - MIT license correctly implemented |
| 4 | .gitignore configured | ✅ COMPLETE | .gitignore:1-169 - comprehensive patterns |
| 5 | CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines | ✅ COMPLETE | CONTRIBUTING.md:1-192 - excellent quality |
| 6 | GitHub Pages setup configured | ✅ COMPLETE | mkdocs.yml:1-85 - professional configuration |
| 7 | Repository publicly accessible on GitHub | ❌ INCOMPLETE | GitHub repository not yet created |
| 8 | Initial commit created | ❌ INCOMPLETE | Git status shows "No commits yet" |
| 9 | DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md created | ✅ COMPLETE | DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md:1-385 - comprehensive |

**Coverage:** 6 of 9 ACs complete (67%)

### Issues Identified

#### 1. HIGH SEVERITY - Task 5 Not Executed
- **Finding:** Initial commit not created, GitHub repository not set up
- **Evidence:** `git status` shows "No commits yet"; Task 5 checkboxes unchecked
- **Impact:** Story cannot be marked "Done" until AC 7-8 completed
- **Recommendation:** Execute Task 5 subtasks:
  - Create initial commit
  - Create GitHub repository (public)
  - Add remote origin
  - Push to GitHub
  - Configure repository settings (description, topics, GitHub Pages)

#### 2. MEDIUM SEVERITY - Placeholder URLs Not Replaced
- **Finding:** Documentation contains placeholder URLs
- **Locations:**
  - README.md:44,88,89 - `https://github.com/your-org/maestro`
  - mkdocs.yml:7 - `repo_url: https://github.com/your-org/maestro`
- **Impact:** URLs will be broken until replaced with actual repository
- **Recommendation:** Replace placeholders when GitHub repository is created

#### 3. LOW SEVERITY - .gitignore Excludes BMAD Core
- **Finding:** .gitignore:162-163 excludes `.bmad-core/` and `.ai/`
- **Assessment:** This appears intentional for local development tooling
- **Recommendation:** Verify this is intentional (likely correct)

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns for static documentation/configuration files

**Observations:**
- .gitignore correctly excludes sensitive patterns (.env files)
- No credentials or secrets in committed files
- MIT license appropriate for open-source research tool

### Performance Considerations

**N/A** - Static files have no performance implications

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

- **Security:** ✓ PASS - Appropriate .gitignore patterns, no secrets
- **Performance:** N/A - Static documentation
- **Reliability:** ✓ PASS - Simple, well-structured file organization
- **Maintainability:** ✓ PASS - Excellent documentation, clear structure
- **Usability:** ✓ PASS - Comprehensive setup instructions for all platforms
- **Portability:** ✓ PASS - Cross-platform instructions included
