# Story 1.5: Create Git Integration Best Practices Guide

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** researcher managing Meta-analysis data over weeks or months,
**I want** clear guidance on using Git for version control of data cards and project files,
**so that** I can track changes, revert mistakes, and collaborate with team members without losing work or creating conflicts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git best practices documentation created (`docs/git-integration.md`) covering: repository initialization, recommended .gitignore patterns, commit message conventions for research workflows
2. Guide explains branching strategy: main branch for validated extractions, feature branches for exploratory/draft work, how to merge when validation completes
3. Instructions for common workflows provided: "How to version a data card," "How to track extraction criteria changes," "How to handle conflicts when two team members extract the same paper"
4. Documentation assumes basic Git familiarity but provides command examples for all recommended operations
5. Guidance on what NOT to commit (large PDFs, API keys, personal notes files) with .gitignore template
6. Async collaboration workflow explained (no real-time co-editing; use PRs for dual-screening conflict resolution)
7. Troubleshooting section for common Git issues (merge conflicts in data cards, recovering from accidental commits)

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

Story 1.5 completes the foundational Epic 1 by providing Git integration guidance that enables researchers to version control their MAestro projects, data cards, and prompt templates. This story builds on the repository structure established in Story 1.1 and supports the collaborative workflows needed for Stories 1.6 (testing) and future epics.

**Critical importance:** Git integration is essential for:
- **Reproducibility:** RAAA (Reproducible AI-Assisted Analysis) requires version-controlled extraction workflows
- **Collaboration:** Teams need async workflows for dual extraction and peer review
- **Safety:** Researchers need to track changes and recover from mistakes
- **Academic credibility:** Version history provides audit trail for data extraction decisions

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.1 (Repository Initialization):**
- Monorepo structure established with `prompts/`, `modules/`, `templates/`, `docs/`, `examples/` directories
- .gitignore configured for IDE files, OS files, temporary files [Source: .gitignore]
- Initial commit created establishing Git baseline (AC #8)
- Repository publicly accessible on GitHub

**From Story 1.2 (Data Card Format):**
- Data cards are markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Git-friendly format (plain text, human-readable)
- Three-color labeling system uses emoji characters (🟢🟡🔴)
- Version-controllable via Git

**From Story 1.3 (Generic Quality Checklist):**
- Quality checklists are markdown files in `modules/` directory
- Versioned using filename conventions (e.g., `generic_v1.0`)
- Changes to checklists should be tracked for reproducibility

**From Story 1.4 (Microscope Prompt):**
- Prompt templates versioned with semantic versioning (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- CHANGELOG.md tracks version history
- Never overwrite existing versions (create new files instead)

**Key Design Principles:**
- Assume basic Git familiarity but provide complete command examples
- Focus on research-specific workflows (data extraction, peer review, dual screening)
- Emphasize reproducibility and academic credibility requirements
- Provide troubleshooting for common meta-analysis Git challenges

### MAestro Architecture Context

**Local-First Architecture** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#local-first-with-cloud-augmentation]
- All user data stored locally (filesystem + SQLite in CROS phase)
- Git is primary version control mechanism
- No cloud backend means Git is critical for backup and collaboration
- Offline workflow requires local Git repository

**Filesystem as Source of Truth** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-1]
- Data cards, prompts, and templates stored as files
- Git tracks changes to filesystem
- SQLite (CROS phase) stores only metadata, indexes filesystem
- File-based architecture is Git-optimized

**Data Card Microservice Architecture** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pattern-2]
- Each data card is independent markdown file
- Atomic units that can be created, validated, versioned independently
- Git-friendly: concurrent extractions on separate branches
- Failed extractions don't corrupt project state

**Template-Driven Workflow** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pattern-1]
- Prompts stored as versioned templates in `prompts/` directory
- Versioning critical for RAAA reproducibility
- Git tracks which template version was used for each extraction

**RAAA (Reproducible AI-Assisted Analysis):**
- Git version history provides audit trail
- Commit messages document extraction decisions
- Tags mark major milestones (screening complete, extraction complete)
- Reproducibility requirement from PRD

**User Meta-Analysis Projects** (not in MAestro repo, separate Git repos):
```
my_meta_analysis/                 # User project (separate Git repo)
├── data_cards/                   # VERSION CONTROLLED: Extracted data

```

**What to Version Control:**
- ✅ Data cards (.md files in data_cards/)
- ✅ Compiled datasets (.csv files in compiled/)
- ✅ Analysis code (.R, .py files in analyses/)
- ✅ Project configuration (project_config.yaml)
- ✅ Documentation (README.md, methodology notes)
- ✅ Custom quality checklists (if created)

**What NOT to Version Control:**
- ❌ Research paper PDFs (copyright, large files)
- ❌ API keys and credentials (.env files)
- ❌ Personal notes (private reviewer comments)
- ❌ Temporary files (editor backups, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- ❌ Build artifacts (CROS: __pycache__, node_modules/, dist/)
- ❌ Local SQLite databases (CROS: .db files - user-specific)

### Existing .gitignore Configuration

[Source: .gitignore]

Current .gitignore includes:
- **IDE-specific:** .vscode/, .idea/, *.sublime-project, etc.
- **OS-specific:** .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, Desktop.ini
- **Python:** __pycache__, *.pyc, venv/, .env
- **Node.js:** node_modules/, dist/, package-lock.json
- **Testing:** .pytest_cache/, .coverage, htmlcov/
- **Environment:** .env, .env.local
- **Logs:** *.log, logs/
- **Temporary:** tmp/, temp/, *.tmp, *.bak
- **Documentation:** site/, .mkdocs_cache/
- **Project-specific:** .bmad-core/, .ignore/, .ai/, local_data/, research_data/

**Recommended additions for user meta-analysis projects:**
```gitignore
# Research papers (large PDFs)
papers/*.pdf
*.pdf

# Personal notes
notes/
personal/
*.notes

# SQLite databases (user-specific in CROS phase)
*.db
*.sqlite

# Large data files
*.csv.gz
*.zip
*.tar.gz

# Statistical software temporary files
.Rhistory
.RData
.Rproj.user/
```

### Git Workflows for Meta-Analysis

**Workflow 1: Solo Researcher - Linear Workflow**
1. Initialize repository: `git init`
2. Extract data card: Run Microscope → save data_cards/paper1.md
3. Stage and commit: `git add data_cards/paper1.md && git commit -m "extract: Add Smith-2020 RCT data card"`
4. Repeat for each paper
5. Compile dataset: Run Compiler → save compiled/dataset.csv
6. Commit compilation: `git add compiled/ && git commit -m "compile: Generate dataset from 15 papers"`

**Workflow 2: Dual Extraction - Feature Branch Workflow**
1. Reviewer A creates branch: `git checkout -b extraction-a/smith-2020`
2. Reviewer A extracts: Microscope → data_cards/smith-2020-a.md
3. Reviewer A commits: `git commit -m "extract: Smith-2020 data (Reviewer A)"`
4. Reviewer A pushes: `git push origin extraction-a/smith-2020`
5. Reviewer B creates branch: `git checkout -b extraction-b/smith-2020`
6. Reviewer B extracts: Microscope → data_cards/smith-2020-b.md
7. Reviewer B commits and pushes
8. Reconciliation: Compare branches, create consensus data card
9. Merge consensus to main: `git checkout main && git merge --squash extraction-consensus/smith-2020`

**Workflow 3: Iterative Refinement with Branches**
1. Create experimental branch: `git checkout -b experiment/new-quality-criteria`
2. Modify quality checklist: Edit modules/custom_checklist.md
3. Re-extract sample papers using new criteria
4. Compare results: `git diff main...experiment/new-quality-criteria`
5. If improvement: Merge to main, tag version
6. If no improvement: Abandon branch, return to main

### Commit Message Conventions

**Format:**
```
<type>: <brief summary (50 chars)>

<optional detailed description>
```

**Types for Meta-Analysis Workflows:**
- `extract:` - New data card extraction
- `review:` - Quality assessment or peer review update
- `fix:` - Correction to existing data card
- `update:` - Revision based on new criteria
- `compile:` - Dataset compilation
- `analyze:` - Statistical analysis code
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `config:` - Project configuration changes

**Good Examples:**
```
extract: Add Jones-2019 observational study data card
review: Update quality scores for Smith-2020 after dual screening
fix: Correct effect size calculation in Brown-2021 (Table 2)
update: Revise inclusion criteria to exclude case studies
compile: Generate final dataset from 42 papers for meta-regression
analyze: Add forest plot generation script using metafor
docs: Update README with extraction protocol changes
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
wip (too vague)
fixed stuff (not specific)
data card (missing context)
asdf (meaningless)
Updated files (no research context)
```

### Branching Strategy

**Main Branch (main/master):**
- Contains validated, peer-reviewed extractions
- Protected: requires pull request for changes (team projects)
- Tagged at major milestones (v1.0-screening-complete, v2.0-extraction-complete)
- Deployable: ready for compilation and analysis

**Feature Branches:**
- `extraction/<paper-identifier>` - Individual paper extractions
- `review/<study-id>` - Peer review and validation work
- `experiment/<description>` - Testing new methodologies
- `fix/<issue-description>` - Bug fixes and corrections

**Branch Lifecycle:**
1. Create from main: `git checkout -b extraction/author-year`
2. Work on feature: Multiple commits
3. Push to remote: `git push -u origin extraction/author-year`
4. Create pull request (if team project)
5. Peer review and discussion
6. Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge extraction/author-year`
7. Delete feature branch: `git branch -d extraction/author-year`
8. Delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete extraction/author-year`

### Collaboration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Async Pull Request Review**
- One reviewer extracts, creates PR
- Team reviews PR, adds comments on specific lines
- Discussions happen in PR thread (GitHub/GitLab)
- Revisions committed to same branch
- Merge after approval

**Pattern 2: Dual Extraction with Comparison**
- Two reviewers extract same paper independently
- Both create separate branches
- Use `git diff branch-a branch-b` to compare
- Create consensus branch merging both extractions
- Document discrepancies in commit message

**Pattern 3: Progressive Consensus Building**
- Initial extraction on feature branch
- Multiple rounds of review commits
- Each review adds corrections/validations
- Squash merge to main when validated
- Preserves clean main branch history

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: YAML Merge Conflicts**
```yaml
<<<<<<< HEAD
extraction_date: 2024-10-15
extractor: Reviewer A
=======
extraction_date: 2024-10-20
extractor: Reviewer B
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```
**Resolution:** Choose correct values, ensure valid YAML syntax

**Issue 2: Table Merge Conflicts**
```markdown
<<<<<<< HEAD
| Outcome | n | Mean | SD |
|---------|---|------|-----|
| Depression | 42 | 12.3 | 3.1 🟢 |
=======
| Outcome | n | Mean | SD |
|---------|---|------|-----|
| Depression | 40 | 12.5 | 3.2 🟢 |
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```
**Resolution:** Compare with source paper, create consensus row, use 🔴 if uncertain

**Issue 3: Accidental PDF Commit**
```bash
# If not yet pushed:
git reset HEAD~1
git checkout -- large-file.pdf
echo "*.pdf" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "fix: Add .gitignore for PDF files"

# If already pushed (requires force push - coordinate with team!):
git rm --cached papers/*.pdf
echo "*.pdf" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "fix: Remove accidentally committed PDFs"
# Inform team before: git push --force
```

### Technology Stack Integration

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Git Version:** 2.40+ required
- Modern Git features (sparse checkout, partial clone for large repos)
- Improved performance for large repositories
- Better merge conflict resolution

**GitHub/GitLab Integration (Optional):**
- Remote repository hosting for backup and collaboration
- Pull request workflows for peer review
- Issues for tracking extraction tasks
- GitHub Actions (Story 1.7) for CI/CD

**Cross-Platform Considerations:**
- Use LF line endings (configure `.gitattributes`)
- Use pathlib conventions in documentation (forward slashes)
- Test Git commands on Windows, macOS, Linux

### File Locations and Naming

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Documentation location:**
```
docs/
├── git-integration.md         # THIS STORY - Git best practices guide
```

**Related files:**
```
.gitignore                     # Already exists, referenced in guide
.gitattributes                 # Optional: line ending configuration
```

### Testing

**MVP Phase Testing Philosophy:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

For Story 1.5 (documentation creation):
- **No automated tests required** (documentation only)
- **Manual validation approach:**
  1. Verify documentation completeness (all 7 AC sections present)
  2. Test Git commands on all three platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  3. Validate command examples produce expected outputs
  4. Review troubleshooting scenarios with realistic test cases
  5. Verify .gitignore recommendations work correctly
  6. Test branching workflows with sample meta-analysis project
  7. Ensure cross-platform compatibility (path conventions, line endings)

**Validation Criteria:**
- All Git commands tested and verified
- Examples produce expected outputs
- Troubleshooting solutions resolve described issues
- .gitignore patterns exclude intended files
- Documentation clarity validated by non-Git-expert reviewer
- Cross-platform commands work on Windows, macOS, Linux

### Cross-Platform Git Considerations

**Line Endings:**
Create `.gitattributes` file:
```
# Ensure consistent line endings
*.md text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.csv text eol=lf
*.R text eol=lf
*.py text eol=lf
```

**Path Separators:**
- Use forward slashes in documentation examples: `data_cards/study.md`
- Git automatically converts on Windows
- Never use backslashes in Git commands

**Command Compatibility:**
- All Git commands work identically on Windows/macOS/Linux
- Shell differences (PowerShell vs Bash) affect piping, not Git itself
- Document both Unix and PowerShell alternatives where relevant

### Integration with Future Stories

**Story 1.6 (Testing Microscope):**
- Git best practices enable version control of test data cards
- Testing process will commit sample data cards to examples/
- Git history tracks testing iterations

**Story 1.7 (CI/CD Pipeline):**
- GitHub Actions workflows rely on Git for triggering
- PR-based workflows use Git branching strategies
- Automated validation of data card commits

**Epic 2 (Compiler):**
- Compiler aggregates data cards from Git-tracked files
- Git history provides audit trail for compiled datasets
- Versioned compilations enable reproducibility

**Epic 3 (Documentation & Validation):**
- RAAA appendix generation references Git history
- Reproducibility documentation cites commit hashes
- Academic credibility enhanced by version control audit trail

### Deliverables Summary

By end of this story, the following file should exist:

**`docs/git-integration.md`** - Comprehensive Git best practices guide with:
- Repository initialization and .gitignore configuration
- Branching strategy for research workflows (main + feature branches)

- Guidance on what NOT to commit (PDFs, API keys, personal notes)
- Async collaboration workflow (PRs, dual screening)
- Troubleshooting section (merge conflicts, accidental commits, large repos)
- Best practices and command reference
- Cross-platform compatibility notes
- Integration with MAestro tools (Microscope, Compiler, Oracle)

File should be committed to Git and referenced in project documentation index.
