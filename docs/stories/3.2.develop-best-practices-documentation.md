### Tool Ecosystem Context

**Microscope v1.0:**
- Single-paper analysis prompt enabling structured workflow: screening decision ‚Üí quality assessment ‚Üí data extraction
- Produces markdown data card with YAML frontmatter (metadata) + markdown table (extracted data)
- Requires three-color labeling for all data points (üü¢ direct evidence, üü° computed/inferred, üî¥ uncertain/missing)
- Target performance: <5 minutes per paper for typical 8-10 page journal articles
- Token consumption: ~2,000-3,000 tokens per paper (at Claude pricing: ~$0.01-0.015 per paper)
- Users must manage context window: Claude 3.5 Sonnet has 200K token window; large papers may require section-by-section extraction

[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1-microscope]

**Compiler v1.0:**
- Aggregates multiple data card markdown files into unified CSV/TSV dataset
- Preserves three-color labels and generates data quality summary (percentage üü¢/üü°/üî¥)
- Validates schema compliance and handles heterogeneous data cards (different extraction fields)
- Target performance: <30 seconds for 10-20 cards, scaling to 100 cards
- Token consumption: ~500-1,000 tokens per batch regardless of batch size (efficient batching)
- Output CSV columns: study_id, authors, year, sample_size, intervention, comparison, outcome_measure, effect_size, confidence_interval_lower, confidence_interval_upper, quality_score, source_color_label, data_card_file, extraction_date, extractor_name

[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-compiler]

**Oracle v1.0:**
- Natural language interface for statistical analysis
- Accepts research questions in plain English (e.g., "What is the pooled effect size?", "Is there significant heterogeneity?")
- Generates R or Python code for common meta-analysis operations: pooled effect (fixed/random effects), heterogeneity (I¬≤, Q-test), subgroup analysis, forest plots
- Includes pedagogical comments explaining statistical concepts
- Interprets results in accessible language with data quality flag handling
- Target performance: <2 minutes for code generation + execution
- Token consumption: ~1,000-2,000 tokens per analysis question (depends on CSV size and analysis complexity)

### Cost Estimation Framework

**Per-Project Cost Breakdown (based on 14-paper esophageal cancer case study):**

| Phase | Papers | Calls | Tokens/Call | Cost/Call | Total Cost | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Microscope** | 14 | 14 | 2,500 avg | $0.02 | $0.28 | ~5 min per paper; manage context window for large papers |
| **Compiler** | 1 | 1 | 750 avg | $0.01 | $0.01 | Batch all 14 cards in single call; <30 sec execution |
| **Oracle** | 5 questions | 5 | 1,500 avg | $0.015 | $0.075 | Pooled effect, heterogeneity, 3 subgroup analyses |
| **Overhead** | N/A | Minimal | N/A | ~$0.01 | $0.01 | Prompt loading, validation, error recovery |
| **TOTAL** | 14 papers | 20 calls | avg 1,350 | avg $0.012 | ~$0.39 | **~$0.03 per paper** |

**Scaling to 50-paper project:** ~$1.50 total
**Scaling to 100-paper project:** ~$3.00 total
**Published methodology**: Typical cost range for full meta-analysis pipeline: $3-10 per project (confirmed in Epic 3 AC1)

[Source: Cost estimated from tech-stack.md Claude pricing + observed token usage from Story 2.6]

### Workflow Optimization Strategies

**Token Efficiency:**
1. **Batch Compiler calls:** Always compile 10-20 data cards per call; do not call Compiler for each individual card
2. **Paper pre-screening:** Filter papers by inclusion criteria BEFORE Microscope extraction to avoid wasted tokens on out-of-scope papers
3. **Prompt caching:** Store commonly-used quality checklists in conversation context to reduce repetition
4. **Section-by-section extraction:** For papers >15,000 words, extract "Results" section only first to determine relevance before full extraction

**Common Pitfalls from Testing:**
1. **Single-session paper processing:** ‚ùå DON'T process all 14 papers in one conversation (will exceed context window)
   - ‚úÖ DO: Process papers in batches of 2-3 per conversation session
2. **Over-extraction:** ‚ùå DON'T extract every table and figure from papers
   - ‚úÖ DO: Extract only outcome measures relevant to research question
3. **Premature compilation:** ‚ùå DON'T compile incomplete data card sets
   - ‚úÖ DO: Extract all papers first, validate quality, then compile
4. **Ignoring quality flags:** ‚ùå DON'T use üî¥ data without sensitivity analysis
   - ‚úÖ DO: Document üî¥ reasoning, conduct analyses with/without üî¥ data

### Three-Color Labeling Standards

**Decision Framework (from Story 3.1 user testing):**

| Label | Meaning | When to Use | Examples |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| üü¢ **Green** | Direct evidence from paper | Study explicitly reports this value | Sample size reported in Table 1, Effect size from Figure 3, Authors' stated conclusion |
| üü° **Yellow** | Computed or inferred from paper | You calculated/derived value from reported data | Confidence interval computed from reported SE, Sample size inferred from demographic table, Outcome metric converted from reported measure |
| üî¥ **Red** | Uncertain or missing | Value not in paper, requires assumption | Study didn't report confidence interval, Outcome measured but not reported, Unmeasured confounding suspected |

**User Feedback from Testing:** Decision tree with concrete examples was most helpful. Users struggled most with üü° vs. üî¥ distinction when data was "partially reported" (e.g., effect size without confidence interval).

[Source: docs/stories/3.1.create-quick-start-guide-with-example-workflow.md#three-color-labeling-decision-tree]

### Discipline-Specific Adaptations

**Generic Module (Currently Available):**
- `modules/generic/generic_quality_checklist.md` ‚Äî Discipline-agnostic quality assessment
- Covers: publication bias indicators, sample size adequacy, outcome measure clarity, statistical reporting completeness
- Story 1.3 notes: Generic module suitable for exploratory analysis across any discipline

**Future Discipline Modules (To Be Referenced):**
- Medical/Clinical: RoB2 checklist (Story 2.2 mentioned `modules/rob2/rob2_checklist.md`)
- Psychology: Preferred Reporting Items for reviews (PRISMA-P specific to psychology)
- Education: EPPI-Centre quality criteria
- Economics: Campbell Collaboration standards

**For Best Practices Doc:** Provide guidance on adapting extraction prompts for discipline-specific considerations (study design recognition, outcome measure interpretation, statistical method evaluation)

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#modules]

### Documentation Standards

**Standards to Conform To (from coding-standards.md):**
- **Rule 6:** Generated code (example code snippets) must be self-contained, runnable, and commented
- **Rule 7:** File paths and examples must be cross-platform compatible (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **Accessibility:** Assume researcher-level technical knowledge, not advanced software engineering expertise
- **Examples:** Use real data from Story 2.6 esophageal cancer case study where possible

**Testing Philosophy (from test-strategy-and-standards.md):**
- Documentation reviews appropriate for MVP phase (no automated testing)
- Expert review by experienced Meta-analysis researcher validates methodological accuracy
- User feedback loops important for improving guidance

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rules-6-7, docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Use Case Distinction: Exploratory vs. Publication-Grade

**Key AC2 Requirement:** Help users understand when MAestro is appropriate vs. when traditional tools are better

**Exploratory Meta-Analysis (MAestro Ideal):**
- RQs: Broad exploratory questions (e.g., "What's the overall effect of X intervention?")
- Timeline: Rapid proof-of-concept (days to weeks)
- Papers: 5-20 papers; high heterogeneity acceptable
- Rigor: Sufficient for internal decision-making, proof-of-concept funding proposals
- Example: "Is intervention X worth investigating further for clinical trial?" (answer in 8 hours vs. 35-50 hours)

**Publication-Grade Meta-Analysis (Traditional Tools Recommended):**
- RQs: Precise research questions requiring pre-registration
- Timeline: Methodical approach (weeks to months)
- Papers: 50+ papers; strict inclusion criteria; pre-registered protocol
- Rigor: Meets journal standards; PRISMA checklist compliance; prospective registration (PROSPERO)
- Example: "What is the long-term safety profile of X drug?" (requires systematic protocol, expert oversight)

**Hybrid Approach (MAestro as Accelerator):**
- Use MAestro for preliminary rapid review to scope research question
- Transition to traditional systematic review tools for publication-grade analysis
- Use MAestro extraction as data entry verification step in traditional workflow
