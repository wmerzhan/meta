# Story 3.5: Conduct Validation Studies with Beta Testers

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

**Ready for Review**

## Story

**As a** solo founder seeking to validate MVP assumptions,
**I want** beta testers to complete systematic validation studies,
**so that** I can empirically verify extraction accuracy, time savings, and usability claims before broader release.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Validation protocol designed: each beta tester extracts data from 10-20 papers using Microscope, at least 3 papers per tester have expert manual extraction "gold standard" for comparison (pre-existing or tester provides their own)
2. Accuracy validation conducted: compare AI-extracted data against gold standard, calculate agreement percentage (target: 90%+ for 🟢 labeled data, document disagreement patterns)
3. Time savings measured: testers log extraction time per paper and compare against their typical manual workflow (target: 50% reduction)
4. Usability metrics collected: time-to-first-data-card for new users (target: <45 minutes), task completion rate (target: 80%+ complete 10+ papers), user confidence self-ratings
5. Three-color labeling effectiveness evaluated: percentage of uncertain/computed data successfully flagged 🟡/🔴, false positive/negative rates
6. Failure mode documentation: collect all errors, bugs, confusion points, prompt failures encountered by beta testers with categorization
7. Qualitative feedback gathered: structured interviews or surveys asking "What worked well? What frustrated you? Would you use this for real projects? What's missing?"
8. Results documented in validation report with aggregate statistics, anonymized user quotes, recommendations for improvement

## Dev Notes

### Story 3.4 (Recruit and Onboard Beta Testers) - Dependencies

**Story 3.4 Status:** ✅ Ready for Review (88/100 QA pass)

**Key Outputs from Story 3.4:**
- **Beta Tester Roster:** 5-10 confirmed participants with documented diversity across disciplines, career stages, and technical comfort levels (requirement: AC2 from Epic 3)
- **Onboarding Package:** Quick Start Guide, Best Practices, feedback survey templates, weekly check-in schedule, communication channels established (GitHub Discussions primary + optional Discord)
- **Cost Support Plan:** Each tester has confirmed API funding path (institutional access or founder subsidy with $50-100 budget)
- **Expectations Documentation:** Clear communication of MVP status, 7 known limitations, 10-20 hour commitment over 4-6 weeks, success criteria
- **Communication Infrastructure:** GitHub Discussions (5 categories), optional Discord server, weekly check-in schedule, escalation procedures
- **Contingency Plan:** If <5 testers recruited, extended solo testing planned (20+ papers, 5+ disciplines) maintains validation goals

**Critical Prerequisite:** Story 3.5 can ONLY begin once Story 3.4 is complete and beta testers are onboarded. Validation studies depend on having committed testers with clear expectations, access to MAestro tools, and established communication channels.

### Validation Study Framework

**Overall Approach:**
- **Timeframe:** 4-6 weeks concurrent with Story 3.4 onboarding (Week 5 onboarding → Week 5-6 active testing → Week 6-7 results compilation)
- **Sample Size:** 5-10 beta testers (per AC from Story 3.4)
- **Papers per Tester:** 10-20 papers per tester = 50-200 total papers tested
- **Gold Standard:** 3+ papers per tester with manual extraction reference (3-5 papers × 5-10 testers = 15-50 gold standard papers)
- **Contingency Path:** If recruitment fails, extended solo testing (20+ papers, 5+ disciplines) follows AC9 from Story 3.4

**Measurement Strategy (AC1):**
- **Validation Protocol Design:** Document before testing begins
  - Define "gold standard" source (published data, manual extraction by tester, published reviews)
  - Specify comparison methodology (field-by-field agreement, statistical metric selection)
  - Define sample methodology (random selection from tester's 10-20, stratified by paper type, etc.)
  - Create standardized data validation template
  - Document edge cases and special handling rules

### Accuracy Validation (AC2)

**Target Metric:** ≥90% agreement on critical fields for 🟢 labeled data

**Critical Fields to Validate:**
- Effect size (HR, OR, RR, MD, SMD, correlation) — exact match or within ±5% tolerance
- Sample size (N per arm, total N) — exact match required
- Study authors (at least lead author match required)
- Year of publication (exact match required)
- Study design (RCT, cohort, case-control) — must match gold standard classification
- Population characteristics (age range, disease status) — general match acceptable

**Data Quality Labels to Track:**
- 🟢 (Green): AI extraction fully matches gold standard, high confidence
- 🟡 (Yellow): AI extraction uncertain, requires human review (e.g., computed effect size, ambiguous reporting)
- 🔴 (Red): AI extraction failed, missing data, or conflicting with gold standard (e.g., hallucinated effect size)

**Accuracy Calculation:**
- For each tester's 3-5 gold standard papers, count field agreements vs. total fields compared
- Calculate: Accuracy % = (Matching fields / Total fields) × 100
- Success criterion: ≥90% of papers show ≥90% field accuracy (AC2)
- Document disagreement patterns: systematic errors (e.g., consistently misreading tables), discipline-specific issues, paper complexity effects

**Data Quality Distribution:**
- Expected distribution (from Epic 1-2 testing): 60-70% 🟢, 20-30% 🟡, 5-10% 🔴
- Track actual distribution from beta testers
- Identify papers where red flag rate > expected (may indicate edge cases)

[Source: docs/stories/3.5.conduct-validation-studies-with-beta-testers.md (Epic 3 AC2)]

### Time Savings Measurement (AC3)

**Data to Collect from Each Tester:**
- **Time Log Template:** For each paper extracted:
  - Paper ID / reference
  - Extraction start time (hour:minute)
  - Extraction end time (hour:minute)
  - Total time (minutes)
  - Number of interactions with Claude (cycles/edits needed)
  - Any blockers or errors encountered (brief note)

- **Baseline Comparison:**
  - Ask each tester at start: "How long does it typically take you to manually extract one paper?" (hours per paper)
  - Ask at end: "How long did it take you with MAestro on average?" (minutes per paper)
  - Calculate: Time Savings % = ((Manual minutes - MAestro minutes) / Manual minutes) × 100

**Success Criteria (AC3):**
- Target: ≥50% time reduction averaged across all testers
- Example: If tester normally spends 30 minutes/paper, target with MAestro is ≤15 minutes/paper
- Document variation: which paper types extract faster (simple RCT, well-formatted) vs. slower (complex designs, poor PDF quality)
- Document confounding factors: tester technical comfort, paper quality, Microscope familiarity

**Workflow Phase Timing:**
- Break down extraction into phases per best practices (story 3.2):
  - Phase 1: Paper orientation & initial read (minutes)
  - Phase 2: First Claude interaction (minutes)
  - Phase 3: Review & iteration cycles (minutes)
  - Phase 4: Data validation & finalization (minutes)
- Track which phases are faster/slower vs. manual workflow

[Source: Epic 3 AC3 requirements]

### Usability Metrics (AC4)

**Time-to-First-Data-Card (Target: <45 minutes)**
- Measure: From first login/interaction with Microscope to completion of first valid data card
- Success: ≥80% of testers complete first data card in <45 minutes
- Document time distribution: Did testers reach 45 min target? Which bottlenecks delayed completion?
- Context: Story 3.1 user testing showed 40-41 minutes; expect similar or faster with experienced testers

**Task Completion Rate (Target: 80%+ complete 10+ papers)**
- Measure: Of testers who commit to 10-20 papers, what % complete ≥10 papers?
- Success: ≥80% of testers complete full commitment (10+ papers)
- Document: If some don't complete, why? (blockers, time constraints, confusion, low motivation)
- Track per-paper completion (paper-level dropout rate, if any)

**User Confidence Self-Ratings (Weekly + End-of-Beta)**
- Weekly surveys ask: "Rate your confidence in MAestro's accuracy (1-5 scale)"
- Weekly surveys ask: "Rate clarity of error messages (1-5 scale)"
- Weekly surveys ask: "Are you stuck on anything? (yes/no + description)"
- End-of-beta survey asks: "Overall satisfaction with tool (1-5 scale)"
- Track progression: does confidence increase over 4-6 weeks as testers learn the tool?

[Source: Epic 3 AC4 requirements]

### Three-Color Labeling Effectiveness (AC5)

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Percentage of data labeled 🟡/🔴:** Track how often Microscope flags uncertain data
  - Expected: 30-40% total (🟡 + 🔴 combined)
  - If too low: Microscope may be overconfident, missing uncertainty
  - If too high: Microscope may be overly conservative, adding user burden

- **False Positive Rate (🔴 when data is actually correct):**
  - For each 🔴 (red) label, manually verify: is data actually wrong?
  - Calculate: False positives / total 🔴 labels
  - Success: ≤20% false positive rate (80%+ of red flags are legitimate issues)

- **False Negative Rate (🟢 when data should be 🟡/🔴):**
  - During gold standard comparison, identify data that doesn't match manual extraction
  - Did Microscope label it 🟢 (false negative) or correctly 🟡/🔴?
  - Calculate: False negatives / total mismatches
  - Success: ≤30% false negative rate (70%+ of mismatches are flagged 🟡/🔴)

- **User Reliance on Labels:**
  - Ask testers: "Did you trust the color labels? Did you spot-check green data?"
  - Track: Did testers spot-check papers, or fully trust Microscope?
  - Goal: Labels should guide manual review, not replace it; high user confidence with healthy skepticism

### Failure Mode Documentation (AC6)

**Data Collection Method:**
- **Weekly Sync Calls:** 30-minute check-ins ask "What broke this week? What confused you?"
- **GitHub/Discord Bug Reports:** Encourage testers to report issues real-time with template
- **End-of-Beta Survey:** "List all errors, crashes, hallucinations, confusing prompts you encountered"
- **Dev Notes from Testers:** Any notes in weekly feedback about pain points

**Failure Mode Categorization:**
1. **Prompt Bugs** (Microscope/Compiler/Oracle failures)
   - Hallucinated data (confident wrong values)
   - Missing fields (data present but not extracted)
   - Misunderstood question (e.g., mistaking confounders for outcomes)
   - Statistical errors (e.g., computing wrong effect size)

2. **Tool Usability Issues**
   - Error messages unclear
   - Workflow interruption (required unexpected user input)
   - Lost progress (data not saved between sessions)
   - Formatting/output issues (emoji rendering, table formatting)

3. **Context/Edge Cases**
   - Large papers (>20 pages) causing context window issues
   - Poor PDF quality (scanned, image-based PDFs)
   - Non-English papers
   - Discipline-specific reporting (e.g., economic outcomes different from medical)
   - Complex designs not covered in training data

4. **User Confusion Points**
   - Three-color labeling misunderstood
   - When to use Compiler vs. processing individually
   - How to report confidence in extracted data
   - Appropriate use cases (exploration vs. publication)

**Documentation Format:**
- Create failure mode log: [Date, Tester ID, Category, Severity (Critical/Major/Minor), Description, Reproduction steps, Frequency (first time seen / recurring)]
- Count total unique failure modes
- Prioritize by: Severity × Frequency (critical bug seen twice = higher priority than minor seen once)

### Qualitative Feedback (AC7)

**Structured Interview Questions (End-of-Beta):**
1. "What worked well? What features did you find most useful?"
2. "What frustrated you most? What would you change?"
3. "Did you achieve your research goal with MAestro data?"
4. "Would you use this for real projects? What would need to change?"
5. "What's the #1 missing feature?"
6. "How would you rate MAestro compared to traditional manual extraction?"
7. "Would you recommend to a colleague? Why or why not?"
8. "What surprised you (positively or negatively)?"

**Survey Approach:**
- Offer both sync calls (30-min interviews) and async written responses (anonymity option)
- Record calls (with permission) for quote extraction
- Create interview notes with quotes
- Code responses: themes, sentiment, discipline-specific comments

**Use of Qualitative Data:**
- Identify testimonials (positive quotes for marketing/publication)
- Identify improvement requests (prioritize for Story 3.6 refinement)
- Identify failed use cases (when NOT to recommend MAestro)
- Understand user mental models (how did they conceptualize the tool?)

### Previous Story Insights Integration

**From Story 3.4 Onboarding:**
- Beta testers have been oriented on MVP status (7 known limitations documented)
- Testers understand this is exploratory-grade, not publication-grade
- Communication channels established; testers know how to report issues
- Cost support confirmed; no budget surprises during testing

**From Story 3.1 & 3.2:**
- Quick Start Guide user-tested: 40-41 minutes to first data card (faster than 45-min target)
- Best Practices document: expert-reviewed (88/100), comprehensive
- Common failure modes from Epic 1-2 documented; expect some overlap with beta findings
- Cost baseline established: ~$0.40 per project in Claude API costs

**Expected Implications for 3.5:**
- Validation study should confirm or refute Quick Start findings (time-to-first-data-card)
- Beta tester feedback should identify new failure modes not caught in Epic 1-2 solo testing
- Three-color labeling effectiveness unknown; first empirical measurement
- Discipline-specific adaptations will emerge from diverse tester feedback
