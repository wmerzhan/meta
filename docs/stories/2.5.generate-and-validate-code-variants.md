# Story 2.5: Generate and Validate R and Python Code Variants

<!-- Powered by BMAD Core -->

## Status

**Ready for Review**

## Story

**As a** researcher with preference for either R or Python,
**I want** Oracle to produce functional, well-documented code in my chosen language,
**so that** I can execute analyses in my familiar environment without learning a new language.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Oracle tested with at least 5 common research questions, generating both R and Python variants for each
2. R code validated for correctness: tested by executing with sample compiled dataset from Story 2.3, verifying outputs match expected statistical results
3. Python code validated for correctness: same validation as R (execute with sample data, verify results)
4. Code quality standards met: proper indentation, meaningful variable names, no hard-coded values (uses parameters from compiled data), includes library installation instructions
5. Statistical equivalence verified: R and Python implementations produce same numerical results (within floating-point precision) for identical inputs
6. Forest plot generation tested: both R (using `metafor::forest()`) and Python (using `matplotlib` or similar) produce publication-quality visualizations
7. Documentation of dependencies added: R code lists required packages (`metafor`, `readr`, etc.), Python code lists required packages (`pandas`, `numpy`, `meta`, `matplotlib`)
8. Example code outputs added to `examples/` directory with commented annotations

## Project Structure Notes

- R code examples should be stored at `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/oracle_q*.R` following the pattern established in Story 2.4. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Python code examples should be stored at `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/oracle_q*.py` following the same directory structure. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Test data source: Use compiled CSV from Story 2.3 (found in `examples/sample_meta_analysis/compiled/` directory, typically named with timestamp like `test_4_gold_standards_2025-10-23.csv`). [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#completion-notes-list]
- All code examples should be versioned and documented with metadata comments indicating Oracle version and Claude model used. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-5-prompttemplate-prompt-模板]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.4 created Oracle v1.0 prompt template with comprehensive statistical analysis guidance. This story validates that the template actually generates executable, correct code. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.create-oracle-v1-prompt-template.md#completion-notes-list]
- Story 2.3 validated Compiler outputs with gold standard data cards across multiple disciplines. These same compiled datasets serve as test inputs for Oracle code generation and execution validation. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#completion-notes-list]
- Context window testing from Story 2.3 confirmed Claude can handle 4-10 compiled data records; this story will test if generated R/Python code handles similar scale datasets correctly. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models & Input Schema

- **CompiledDataset Input Schema**: R and Python code must correctly read CSV with required columns: `study_id`, `authors`, `year`, `sample_size`, `intervention`, `comparison`, `outcome_measure`, `effect_size`, `effect_size_metric`, `confidence_interval_lower`, `confidence_interval_upper`, `quality_score`, `source_color_label`. [Source: docs/compiled-data-schema.md#required-columns]
- **Analysis Model (Model 6)**: Output structure includes `research_question` (natural language input), `language` (r or python), `code` (generated script), and `interpretation` (AI-generated textual results). This story validates the code generation aspect for both languages. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-6-analysis-统计分析]
- **Data Quality Labels**: Generated code must handle `source_color_label` column correctly (🟢/🟡/🔴 emoji values). When >20% of rows have 🟡 or 🔴 labels, code should recommend sensitivity analyses. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.create-oracle-v1-prompt-template.md#technical-constraints]

### Library & Dependency Requirements

- **R libraries**: Generated R code must use `metafor` (for meta-analysis calculations), `readr` (for CSV import with proper type handling), and `ggplot2` or `base::plot()` for forest plot visualization. Code should include package installation instructions as comments. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-6-生成的代码必须自包含]
- **Python libraries**: Generated Python code must use `pandas` (CSV reading with nullable integer support), `numpy` (numerical operations), `scipy` (statistical distributions), and `matplotlib` (forest plot visualization). Include `pip install` or `poetry` instructions in code comments. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-6-生成的代码必须自包含]
- **Path handling**: Python code must use `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform file paths, NOT hard-coded Windows/Unix paths. R code should use relative paths without OS-specific separators. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-7-路径必须跨平台兼容]

### Statistical Operations to Test

Based on Oracle v1.0 template capabilities, test at least these 5 research questions:
1. **Pooled Effect Size** (fixed-effect and random-effects models): Tests basic meta-analysis calculation
2. **Heterogeneity Assessment** (I², Q-test): Tests statistical metrics and p-value interpretation
3. **Subgroup Analysis by Study Quality**: Tests stratification logic and conditional filtering using `quality_score` and `source_color_label`
4. **Forest Plot Generation**: Tests data visualization (R: `metafor::forest()`, Python: `matplotlib.pyplot`)
5. **Sensitivity Analysis** (optional 5th variant): Tests data quality flag handling with 🟢-only filtering

For each research question, validate:
- **Correctness**: Execute code and verify output matches meta-analysis formulas (inverse variance weighting for fixed-effect; DerSimonian-Laird τ² estimation for random-effects)
- **Equivalence**: R and Python implementations produce numerically identical results (tolerance: ±0.0001 for point estimates, CI bounds)
- **Quality**: Code has ≥5 inline comments explaining statistical concepts; uses meaningful variable names; includes error handling for missing data

### Code Quality Standards

- **Indentation**: Consistent spacing (R: 2 spaces; Python: 4 spaces) per language conventions
- **Variable Naming**: Descriptive names (`pooled_effect_size`, not `pes`); snake_case for Python, lowercase with dots for R
- **Comments**: Pedagogical comments explaining statistical formulas (e.g., "# Inverse variance weighting for fixed-effect model")
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing values, file not found, invalid CSV columns
- **Installation Instructions**: Each code file includes comments with exact package installation commands (e.g., `# Install: pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib`)

### Testing Strategy

Testing approach follows MVP manual validation pattern: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]

1. **Manual Code Execution**: Run generated R code with R CLI or RStudio; execute Python code with Python 3.9+ CLI
2. **Output Validation**: Check that:
   - R code produces numeric results (point estimates, CI, test statistics)
   - Python code produces equivalent numeric results
   - Forest plots are generated as image files or terminal output
3. **Statistical Equivalence Check**: Compare numerical outputs between R and Python for same research question (allow ±0.0001 tolerance)
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Validate behavior with missing values, all 🟢 labels, high proportion of 🔴 labels

### File Locations & Artifacts

- **R example code files**: `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/oracle_q1_pooled_effect_r.R`, `oracle_q2_heterogeneity_r.R`, etc.
- **Python example code files**: `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/oracle_q3_subgroup_quality_python.py`, `oracle_q5_forest_plot_python.py`, etc.
- **Test data source**: Use validated compiled CSV from Story 2.3 (in `examples/sample_meta_analysis/compiled/` directory)
- **Metadata in code comments**: Each file should include header comments with Oracle version, Claude model version, research question, and generation date

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

- **AC 1**: Generate both R and Python for ≥5 research questions → Create at least 10 code files (5 R + 5 Python)
- **AC 2-3**: Execute and validate R & Python separately → Manual execution with test dataset, verify numeric outputs
- **AC 4**: Code quality standards (indentation, naming, comments, library instructions) → Review all code files for adherence
- **AC 5**: Statistical equivalence (±0.0001 tolerance) → Compare R vs Python outputs for same question
- **AC 6**: Forest plot generation → Both R and Python must produce publication-quality visualization
- **AC 7**: Document dependencies → Include package lists and installation instructions in code comments
- **AC 8**: Example code with annotations → All code files stored in examples/ directory with metadata comments
