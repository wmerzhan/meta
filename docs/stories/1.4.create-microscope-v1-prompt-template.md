# Story 1.4: Create Microscope v1.0 Prompt Template

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** researcher conducting a Meta-analysis,
**I want** a structured prompt template that guides me through systematic paper analysis with Claude Code,
**so that** I can extract high-quality data consistently across papers without manually designing prompts each time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Microscope prompt template file created (`prompts/microscope_v1.md`) as reusable markdown document
2. Prompt includes clear sections: (a) screening decision guidance (include/exclude with rationale), (b) quality assessment framework integrating generic checklist from Story 1.3, (c) data extraction instructions emphasizing three-color labeling
3. Template instructs AI to output data in standardized data card format matching Story 1.2 specifications
4. Prompt explicitly requires three-color labeling for all extracted data points with explanations of label criteria
5. Instructions for handling edge cases included (missing data, unclear reporting, conflicting values across paper sections)
6. **Prompt designed to fit within Claude's context window when combined with typical research paper (tested with 8,000-12,000 word papers representing diverse characteristics: standard IMRAD structure with Methods/Results sections, quantitative study with statistical tables, at least one paper with complex nested data requiring inference)** *(PO Validation: Ambiguous Requirement #1)*
7. Version metadata included in template (version number, creation date, compatible Claude model versions)
8. Usage instructions provided (`docs/microscope-usage.md`) explaining how to use the prompt with Claude Code
9. Example quality assessment completed in sample data card (Story 1.2 example) using integrated checklist

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Story 1.4 builds on Stories 1.2 and 1.3** by creating the **Microscope prompt template** that orchestrates the entire single-paper data extraction workflow.

**Critical importance:** The Microscope prompt created in this story will:
- **Guide users** through screening â†’ quality assessment â†’ data extraction in one conversation
- **Output data cards** in the format defined in Story 1.2
- **Apply quality checklist** created in Story 1.3
- **Serve as foundation** for Story 1.6 (testing Microscope with sample papers)
- **Enable Epic 2** (Compiler will aggregate Microscope-generated data cards)

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 1.2 (Data Card Format):**
- Data card template has 11 required YAML fields + markdown tables
- Three-color labeling system (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´) is core differentiator
- Template includes inline comments for self-service use
- Example data card demonstrates realistic usage
- Manual validation checklist approach for MVP

**From Story 1.3 (Generic Quality Checklist):**
- Generic checklist has 5 methodological domains with 20 total items
- Each domain rated as "low", "medium", or "high" risk
- Overall quality synthesized as "high", "medium", or "low"
- Checklist module ID: `generic_v1.0`
- Quality scores populate data card YAML `quality_scores` field
- Justifications should use three-color labeling for evidence

**Key Design Principles to Apply:**
- Educational design: Prompt should teach AI how to apply standards, not just list rules
- Example-driven: Include concrete examples for each instruction type
- Version metadata: Track prompt version for reproducibility
- Manual validation: Test with real papers, not automated tests (MVP philosophy)

### Microscope Workflow Architecture [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1]

**Workflow 1: Microscope - Single-paper data extraction (CROS phase)**

In MVP phase (this story), the workflow is manual:
1. User loads Microscope prompt template
2. User pastes prompt + research paper into Claude Code conversation
3. Claude Code analyzes paper following prompt instructions
4. AI outputs data card in markdown format
5. User saves data card to `data_cards/` directory

In CROS phase (future), CLI will automate parts of this workflow.

**Critical architectural principle:** Prompt must be self-contained and comprehensive since it's the primary interface between user and AI in MVP.

### Data Models Integration

**Model 1: DataCard [Source: architecture/data-models.md#model-1-datacard]**

Microscope prompt must instruct AI to populate all DataCard fields:

```yaml
# Required fields AI must extract:
study_id: String          # Unique identifier (instruct AI to generate from author_year format)
title: String             # Paper title
authors: List[String]     # Author list
year: Integer             # Publication year
extraction_date: DateTime # Current date
extractor: String         # User's name (AI should ask or use "Claude Code")
microscope_version: String # "v1.0" for this prompt version
claude_model: String      # Model version used (AI should auto-detect or ask)
screening_decision: Enum["include", "exclude"]
quality_scores: Dict[String, Any]  # From quality assessment
extracted_data: List[DataPoint]    # Nested in markdown tables

# Optional fields:
doi: String              # Extract if available
```

**Model 2: DataPoint [Source: architecture/data-models.md#model-2-datapoint]**

Every data point in tables must include:
- `variable_name`: Column header
- `value`: Extracted value
- `source_label`: ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ (REQUIRED)
- `evidence`: Page/section/calculation (REQUIRED)

**Model 8: QualityAssessment [Source: architecture/data-models.md#model-8-qualityassessment]**

Quality assessment output must match:
```yaml
quality_scores:
  checklist_module: "generic_v1.0"
  scores: {
    selection_bias: "low|medium|high",
    measurement_validity: "low|medium|high",
    confounding_control: "low|medium|high",
    attrition_missing_data: "low|medium|high",
    reporting_transparency: "low|medium|high"
  }
  overall_quality: "high|medium|low"
```

### Three-Color Source Labeling System [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pattern-3]

**Pattern 3: Core differentiator for academic credibility**

Microscope prompt must extensively explain and require this system:

**ðŸŸ¢ Green - Direct Quote/Observation:**
- Definition: Data taken directly from paper without interpretation
- Evidence requirement: Page number AND section reference
- Example: "Sample size n=42 (p. 7, Methods section)"
- When to use: Directly reported statistics, exact quotes, values from tables

**ðŸŸ¡ Yellow - Computed/Inferred Value:**
- Definition: Data calculated or inferred from paper information
- Evidence requirement: Calculation formula OR reasoning process + source page numbers
- Example: "Cohen's d = (M1 - M2) / SD_pooled = (5.2 - 4.1) / 1.8 = 0.61 (calculated from Table 2, p. 8)"
- When to use: Computed effect sizes, derived statistics, aggregated values, reasonable inferences

**ðŸ”´ Red - Uncertain/Missing Data:**
- Definition: Data not clearly reported, ambiguous, or completely missing
- Evidence requirement: Explanation of uncertainty or what's missing + impact on analysis
- Example: "Control group size not reported; unable to calculate between-group effect size (Methods section, p. 6)"
- When to use: Missing data, contradictory information, unclear reporting, insufficient information

**Critical PRD Goal:** 90%+ uncertain data flagging [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#pattern-3]

Prompt must emphasize: **When in doubt, use ðŸ”´ and explain the uncertainty.** This ensures academic credibility.

### File Locations and Naming [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Microscope prompt location:**
```
prompts/
â”œâ”€â”€ microscope/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ microscope_v1.0.md    # THIS STORY - Main prompt template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md           # Version history (create if doesn't exist)
```

**Usage documentation location:**
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ microscope-usage.md        # THIS STORY - How to use Microscope
```

**Naming convention:**
- Prompt file: `microscope_v1.0.md` (lowercase, semantic versioning)
- Future versions: `microscope_v1.1.md`, `microscope_v2.0.md` (never overwrite existing versions)

### Technology Stack Implications [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**For MVP (this story):**
- Pure markdown documentation - no code implementation
- Claude Code (user's installation) as execution environment
- Git version control for prompt template versioning
- Compatible Claude models:
  - claude-sonnet-4-5 (primary, 200K context window)
  - claude-opus-4 (alternative, 200K context window)
  - claude-sonnet-3.5 (fallback, 200K context window)

**Context window considerations:**
- Claude Sonnet 4: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
- Typical research paper: 8,000-12,000 words (~10,600-16,000 tokens)
- Microscope prompt budget: Target <5,000 tokens (~3,750 words) to leave ample room for paper content

**For CROS Phase (future):**
- Prompt Template Manager will load this file [Source: architecture/components.md#component-1]
- PyYAML will parse metadata section
- CLI will automate prompt injection and output parsing

### Prompt Design Principles

**1. Self-Contained Instructions:**
- Assume AI has no prior knowledge of MAestro or meta-analysis conventions
- Embed all necessary context (three-color labeling, quality checklist, data card format)
- Don't rely on external references AI can't access

**2. Example-Driven Guidance:**
- Provide concrete examples for every major instruction type
- Show both correct and incorrect approaches where helpful
- Use realistic research scenarios in examples

**3. Structured Output Format:**
- Clearly specify exact output format (YAML frontmatter + markdown tables)
- Provide template structure AI should follow
- Include placeholder examples AI can adapt

**4. Edge Case Handling:**
- Anticipate common extraction challenges (missing data, unclear reporting, calculations)
- Provide decision trees for when to use each source label
- Emphasize conservative approach (ðŸ”´ when uncertain)

**5. Academic Rigor:**
- Emphasize importance of source attribution (page numbers, section references)
- Require justifications for quality assessments
- Promote transparency and reproducibility

### Prompt Structure Outline

Based on acceptance criteria and architecture, the Microscope prompt should be structured as:

```markdown

### Context Window Testing Strategy

**AC #6 requires testing with specific paper characteristics:**

Test papers should include:
1. **Standard IMRAD structure:** Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion sections
2. **Quantitative study:** Statistical analyses, means, SDs, effect sizes, tables
3. **Complex nested data:** Subgroup analyses, multiple outcomes, complex table structures
4. **Word count range:** 8,000-12,000 words

**Testing approach (manual, per MVP philosophy):**
1. Select 2-3 publicly available research papers meeting criteria
2. Copy Microscope prompt + full paper text into Claude Code
3. Verify conversation doesn't exceed context window
4. Review AI-generated data card for completeness and accuracy
5. Document any prompt adjustments needed
6. Confirm all test papers within 8,000-12,000 word range

**No automated tests required for MVP.** Manual validation with representative papers is sufficient.

### Integration with Story 1.2 and 1.3

**Data Card Template Integration [Source: templates/data_card.md]:**
- Microscope must output exact format from Story 1.2
- Include all YAML frontmatter fields (study_id, title, authors, etc.)
- Use markdown table structures (Demographics, Study Design, Outcomes, Effect Sizes, Attrition)
- Apply three-color labeling to all data points
- Populate quality_scores section

**Generic Quality Checklist Integration [Source: modules/generic/generic_quality_checklist.md]:**
- Embed full checklist text in Microscope prompt (5 domains, 20 items)
- Include rating guidance (Low/Medium/High definitions) for each item
- Instruct AI to synthesize overall quality rating
- Format output to match `quality_scores` YAML structure
- Ensure checklist module ID is `generic_v1.0`

**Critical integration point:** Quality assessment justifications in data card body should use three-color labeling to cite evidence from paper.

### Coding Standards (Not Applicable for Documentation)

**Story 1.4 is pure documentation work.** No Python or TypeScript code required.

**Relevant Standards:**
- Use markdown best practices (consistent heading hierarchy, proper list formatting)
- Follow Git-friendly formatting (LF line endings, consistent spacing)
- Include version metadata in prompt header
- Semantic versioning for future prompt updates (v1.0 â†’ v1.1 â†’ v2.0)

### Testing

**MVP Phase Testing Philosophy:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

For Story 1.4 (prompt template creation):
- **No automated tests required** (testing begins in CROS Phase 1)
- **Manual validation approach:**
  1. Verify prompt structure is complete (all AC sections present)
  2. Test prompt with 2-3 sample research papers (8,000-12,000 words, diverse characteristics)
  3. Validate AI-generated data cards match template format
  4. Check three-color labeling is applied appropriately
  5. Verify quality assessments are complete and justified
  6. Confirm context window compatibility (prompt + papers fit within 200K tokens)
  7. Review usage documentation for clarity and completeness
  8. Test example quality assessment in sample data card

**Validation criteria for AI-generated data cards:**
- All required YAML fields present and correctly formatted
- All data points have source labels (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´) with evidence
- Quality assessment includes all 5 domains + overall rating
- Markdown tables are well-formed
- Calculations shown for ðŸŸ¡ labels
- Uncertainty explained for ðŸ”´ labels

**No automated validation until CROS phase** when Data Card Parser and Schema Validator will automate checks.
