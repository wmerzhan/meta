### Common Failure Modes (from Epic 1-2 Testing)

**AC6 Target: Address 5-10 failure modes**

1. **YAML Formatting Issues**
   - Problem: Inconsistent indentation in data card frontmatter breaks YAML parser
   - Symptom: Compiler fails silently or produces malformed CSV
   - Solution: Strict template enforcement, validation checklist with examples
   - Prevalence: Moderate (identified in Story 1.6)

2. **Missing Metadata Fields**
   - Problem: Data cards lack required YAML fields (study_id, extraction_date, extractor)
   - Symptom: CSV has empty columns or row rejection
   - Solution: Pre-fill template with field descriptions, show examples
   - Prevalence: Moderate

3. **Three-Color Labeling Ambiguity**
   - Problem: Researchers uncertain whether data point is ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´
   - Symptom: Inconsistent labeling across papers, unclear reasoning
   - Solution: Decision tree with concrete examples for each category
   - Prevalence: High (identified in Story 1.6)

4. **Context Window Exceeded**
   - Problem: Large papers (15,000+ words) exceed Claude's context window
   - Symptom: Microscope prompt fails or truncates extraction
   - Solution: Guidance on paper selection, section-by-section approach
   - Prevalence: Low but high impact

5. **Encoding Issues with Three-Color Emoji**
   - Problem: CSV emoji characters (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´) render as garbled text in Excel
   - Symptom: Columns appear corrupted when opened in Excel
   - Solution: UTF-8 encoding guidance, alternative CSV import procedures
   - Prevalence: Low but high frustration

6. **Heterogeneous Effect Size Metrics**
   - Problem: Papers report different effect size types (OR, HR, RR, MD)
   - Symptom: Compiler confusion when compiling mixed metrics
   - Solution: Standardization guidance, effect size conversion reference
   - Prevalence: Moderate (common in real meta-analyses)

7. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Problem: Some papers don't report confidence intervals or sample sizes
   - Symptom: ðŸ”´ labels high, uncertainty unclear whether to include
   - Solution: Decision framework for including vs. excluding incomplete data
   - Prevalence: High (realistic research scenario)

8. **Microscope Hallucination (Data Invention)**
   - Problem: AI generates plausible but incorrect statistics not in paper
   - Symptom: Spot-check reveals discrepancies between data card and source
   - Solution: Emphasis on human validation, how to verify extracted data
   - Prevalence: Low but critical quality impact

### Testing & Validation (AC7)

**User Testing Requirements:**
- Test with minimum 2 naive users (unfamiliar with MAestro)
- Target users: Researchers without prior tool exposure
- Success criteria:
  - Complete full workflow (all 5 phases) without blocking
  - Achieve working analysis within 45 minutes
  - Demonstrate understanding of three-color labeling
  - Successfully interpret pooled effect and heterogeneity results
- Collect feedback: Moments of confusion, unclear instructions, missing details
- Document: Time spent on each phase, questions asked, confusion points
- Iterate: Revise guide based on feedback (AC8 for future refinement stories)

### Technical Standards Conformance

**Documentation Standards (docs/architecture/coding-standards.md):**
- All example code must be self-contained, runnable, and commented [Rule 6]
- File paths must be cross-platform compatible (Windows/Mac/Linux) [Rule 7]
- Instructions assume basic researcher familiarity but no advanced technical knowledge
- Terminal output examples must show real execution results, not hypothetical

**Testing Philosophy (docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md):**
- MVP phase relies on manual user validation, not automated testing
- Real user feedback with naive testers is primary validation method
- Target: <40% bounce rate, 10+ minute average session time
- Success: Users complete entire workflow and achieve functional analysis

**Content Strategy (docs/architecture/source-tree.md):**
- Single authoritative guide at `docs/quickstart.md`
- Cross-links to specialized guides (data-card-format.md, compiler-usage.md, oracle-usage.md)
- Progressive disclosure: Simple workflow immediately, advanced options in linked docs

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Testing Approach: WELL-DESIGNED** âœ…

- **Test Type**: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with naive users â€“ appropriate for MVP documentation
- **Test Scope**: Complete end-to-end workflow across 5-6 phases (Setup â†’ Research â†’ Papers â†’ Extraction â†’ Compilation â†’ Analysis â†’ Interpretation)
- **Test Users**: 2 naive researchers (target audience, no prior tool exposure) âœ…
- **Test Data**: 5-paper subset from esophageal cancer case study (available at `examples/e2e_test_meta_analysis/`)
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable and clear (45-min target, no blocking errors, understanding validation)
- **Validation Checklist**: Comprehensive 12-item checklist (lines 381-393) covers all observable outcomes

**Critical Gap**: AC7 user testing not yet executed â€“ this is the final validation gate for NFR4 (time-to-first-value).

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) Validation

| NFR | Requirement | Status | Evidence/Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Performance (NFR4)** | Complete workflow <45 minutes | ðŸŸ¡ UNVALIDATED | Timing planned (estimated <45 min); needs Task 12 user testing |
| **Usability** | Zero-knowledge users succeed | ðŸŸ¡ UNVALIDATED | Protocol designed; needs Task 12 execution |
| **Clarity** | Instructions unambiguous | âœ… PLANNED | Task structure thorough; 30+ examples specified |
| **Completeness** | No external docs needed for core | âœ… PLANNED | Core workflow covered; 6 deep-dive links for advanced |
| **Cross-Platform** | Windows/Mac/Linux compatibility | âœ… PLANNED | Paths validated; emoji rendering tested (per dev notes) |

**Assessment:** NFR4 validation dependent on completing Task 12. This is appropriate â€“ documentation performance claims should be validated with real users.

### Technical Debt Identification

**Debt Level: MINIMAL** âœ…

- Story 3.6 noted as future refinement story (good separation of concerns)
- User testing feedback will inform iterative improvements
- No architectural or code quality debt (documentation story)

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified. Story content intact; only QA Results section appended per protocol.

### Gate Status

**Current Status:** Ready for User Testing (Tasks 1-11 complete)

**Blocking Item:** AC7 User Testing (Task 12) must be completed before publication

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. âœ… **IMMEDIATE:** Execute Task 12 â€“ User testing with 2 naive researchers
   - Use provided testing protocol (Dev Notes - Testing section)
   - Use 12-item validation checklist (lines 381-393)
   - Document results (time, errors, feedback, understanding validation)
   - Expected outcome: PASS if both users complete in <45 min with no blocking errors

2. âœ… **THEN:** Execute Task 13 â€“ Final Review & Publication
   - Verify code snippets functional on all platforms
   - Validate all documentation links
   - Confirm emoji rendering in terminals
   - Publish to `docs/quickstart.md`
   - Update README with quickstart link

### Improvements Checklist

âœ… **Completed by QA:**
- Verified comprehensive AC-to-task mapping (7/8 implemented)
- Validated testing strategy alignment with MVP approach
- Assessed documentation standards compliance
- Identified NFR validation dependency (appropriate gate)
- Confirmed cross-references and example data accuracy

ðŸ“‹ **Pending Dev/Team:**
- [  ] Complete Task 12: Execute user testing with 2 naive researchers
- [  ] Document Task 12 results per validation checklist
- [  ] Complete Task 13: Final verification and publication
- [  ] Update File List to reflect published state

### Security Review

**Assessment: NO SECURITY CONCERNS** âœ…

This is user documentation. No authentication, secrets, or data protection code present. Content assumes appropriate user context (research workflow).

### Performance Considerations

**Assessment: PERFORMANCE VALIDATION PENDING** ðŸŸ¡

- **Claim:** Complete workflow <45 minutes
- **Status:** Estimated in dev notes; requires user testing (Task 12) for validation
- **Scaling:** Target: 5-15 papers; guide scalability noted for future stories
- **User experience:** Timing broken down by phase for transparency

### Recommended Status

**Current:** Ready for User Testing âœ“

**Recommended Path Forward:**
1. **If Task 12 succeeds** (both users complete <45 min, no blockers): **âœ… Ready for Done**
2. **If Task 12 reveals issues** (users exceed time, blocking errors): **Revise â†’ Re-test**
3. **After Task 13 completion:** **ðŸ“– Published**

---

**Summary for Story Owner:**

Story planning is exemplary. Seven of eight acceptance criteria are fully implemented with strong documentation and realistic examples. User testing (Task 12) is the final validation gate and is appropriately designed to measure the core NFR (45-minute time-to-first-value). Recommend proceeding immediately to Task 12 with confidence that the underlying guide structure is sound.
