# Story 2.3: Test Compiler with Data Cards from Epic 1

<!-- Powered by BMAD Core -->

## Status

**Ready for Review** ✅

## Story

**As a** solo founder validating the Compiler workflow,
**I want** to test Compiler v1.0 with data cards generated in Epic 1 Story 1.6,
**so that** I can verify that aggregation works correctly and identify edge cases before beta testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Compiler tested with at least 10 data cards from Epic 1 (sample papers across disciplines)
2. Compilation time measured and documented (target: <30 seconds for 10-20 cards, scaling to 100 cards)
3. Output CSV validated against schema from Story 2.1 (all required columns present, data types correct, no malformed rows)
4. Three-color label preservation verified: manual spot-check that source_color_label column accurately reflects labels from source data cards
5. Data quality summary generated and reviewed: percentage breakdown of 🟢/🟡/🔴 labels matches expectations from Epic 1 testing
6. Edge cases documented and handled: missing fields in data cards, papers with multiple outcomes, heterogeneous effect size metrics
7. Refinements to Compiler prompt implemented based on testing (e.g., improved error messages, better handling of missing data)
8. Example compiled dataset added to `examples/` directory with documented lineage (which data cards were compiled)
9. Context window limit testing conducted: test compilation with 50 data cards and 100 data cards to verify Claude's context limits are not exceeded, document maximum practical limit, provide guidance for batch compilation if limits are reached *(PO Validation: Should-Fix #8 / Ambiguous Requirement #2)*

## Project Structure Notes

- Compiled test outputs should be saved to `examples/sample_meta_analysis/compiled/` for traceability and consistency with existing sample data structure. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Testing documentation and time measurements belong under `tests/validation/` alongside other validation artifacts from Story 2.2, keeping quality assurance centralized. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]
- Gold standard data cards for testing reside in `tests/validation/gold_standards/` (4 currently available); additional data cards from Epic 1 Story 1.6 may be needed to reach the 10+ target. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#testing]
- Context window testing results and batch compilation guidance should be documented in a validation report under `tests/validation/` for future reference. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.2 delivered Compiler v1.0 prompt template (`prompts/compiler/compiler_v1.0.md`) with comprehensive instructions for data card aggregation, schema mapping, three-color label preservation, and quality summary generation. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#completion-notes-list]
- AC#6 from Story 2.2 (20-card context window test) was marked as PARTIAL due to limited available data cards (only 7 available vs. 20 required). This story (2.3) directly addresses that gap by executing real compilation tests. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#qa-results]
- Validation framework established in Story 2.2 includes schema validation scripts (`tests/validation/test_compiled_schema_io.py`, `tests/validation/test_compiled_schema_readr.R`) and a validation test document (`tests/validation/compiler_v1.0_validation.md`). Reuse these for automated verification. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#file-list]
- Story 2.2 QA review identified medium-risk items: simulated validation vs. real execution, and context window limits being theoretical rather than tested. Story 2.3 mitigates these by performing actual execution and context limit testing. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#risk-assessment]
- Usage guide (`docs/compiler-usage.md`) provides three workflows (manual, batch, incremental) and troubleshooting guidance that can be referenced during testing for edge case resolution. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#completion-notes-list]

### Data Models

- **CompiledDataset** model requires metadata fields: `compiler_version`, `source_data_cards`, `data_quality_summary`; ensure test outputs capture these for traceability. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-4-compileddataset-编译数据]
- **DataCard** model specifies structure with YAML frontmatter and markdown tables; gold standard cards in `tests/validation/gold_standards/` conform to this structure and serve as test inputs. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-1-datacard-数据卡片]
- **DataPoint** model defines three-color source labels (🟢/🟡/🔴) as an Enum; validation must confirm compiled CSV preserves these exact emoji values in `source_color_label` column. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-2-datapoint-数据点]
- Prompt template versioning (Model 5) requires `compiler_version` to be embedded in output CSV; test should verify `compiler_v1.0` appears in every row. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-5-prompttemplate-prompt-模板]

### API Specifications

- Claude Code is the execution environment for Compiler v1.0 prompt; testing should be performed within Claude Code sessions to mirror production usage and capture actual context/token usage. [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#api-1-claude-code-内置-ai-模型调用]
- No external API specifications found in architecture docs relevant to Compiler testing workflow.

### Component Specifications

- **Compiler Engine** (Component 4) aggregates heterogeneous data cards into unified tables and produces quality summaries; testing must validate both tabular output and quality summary accuracy against gold standards. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#component-4-compiler-engine]
- **Schema Validator** (Component 3) ensures compiled outputs match schema; leverage existing validation scripts (`test_compiled_schema_io.py`, `test_compiled_schema_readr.R`) to automate schema compliance checks for test outputs. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#component-3-schema-validator]
- **Prompt Template Manager** (Component 1) treats prompts as versioned assets; Compiler v1.0 template must be referenced by exact filename (`prompts/compiler/compiler_v1.0.md`) during testing to ensure version consistency. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#component-1-prompt-template-manager]

### File Locations

- **Compiler prompt template:** `prompts/compiler/compiler_v1.0.md` — use this exact file for all test executions. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- **Gold standard data cards:** `tests/validation/gold_standards/*.md` (4 available: nakashima_2003_cohort.md, reeh_2015_cohort.md, hwang_2015_rct.md, banda_2022_quasi.md) — primary test inputs. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#testing]
- **Test output directory:** `examples/sample_meta_analysis/compiled/` — save compiled CSV files here with descriptive names (e.g., `test_4_gold_standards_2025-10-23.csv`). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- **Validation documentation:** `tests/validation/` — store time measurements, context window test results, edge case documentation, and refinement notes here as markdown files. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]
- **Schema reference:** `docs/compiled-data-schema.md` — authoritative column definitions for validation checks. [Source: docs/compiled-data-schema.md]
- **Usage guide:** `docs/compiler-usage.md` — reference for troubleshooting and workflow execution. [Source: docs/compiler-usage.md]

### Testing

- Follow documented testing structure: store automated validation outputs under `tests/validation/` and integrate with existing schema validation scripts. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]
- Gold standard data cards (`tests/validation/gold_standards/`) provide ready-made inputs for compilation tests; verify they match Data Card Template v1.0 structure before use. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#testing]
- Testing philosophy prioritizes **verification over automation** at MVP stage; manual spot-checks and gold-standard-driven validation are appropriate for this story. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Continuous testing guidance expects cross-platform compatibility; if validation scripts are run, ensure they execute via Poetry/pytest and avoid hard-coded paths. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]

### Technical Constraints

- **Three-color label preservation:** Maintain emoji integrity (🟢/🟡/🔴) in compiled CSV outputs; use UTF-8 encoding without BOM to ensure compatibility. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-2-保留三色标签完整]
- **Prompt template versioning:** Compiler v1.0 must embed `compiler_version = compiler_v1.0` in every output row per semantic versioning discipline. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-3-prompt-模板版本]
- **Context window limits:** Compiler v1.0 is documented for 20-card compilations (~40KB context per batch); testing with 50 and 100 cards (AC#9) will define actual limits and inform batching guidance. [Source: prompts/compiler/compiler_v1.0.md#context-window-management]
- **Schema compliance:** All 18 required columns from `docs/compiled-data-schema.md` must be present with correct data types; validation scripts provide automated checks. [Source: docs/compiled-data-schema.md#required-columns]
- **Data provenance:** Compiled datasets must include `data_card_file` column with relative paths to source data cards for traceability. [Source: docs/compiled-data-schema.md#provenance--cross-links]
- **Missing value conventions:** Use empty strings for unknown text fields and blank cells for missing numeric fields; do NOT write "NA" or "NULL". [Source: docs/compiled-data-schema.md#missing-values--heterogeneous-structures]
