# Story 2.4: Create Oracle v1.0 Prompt Template for Statistical Analysis

<!-- Powered by BMAD Core -->

## Status

**Ready for Done**

## Story

**As a** researcher ready to analyze aggregated Meta-analysis data,
**I want** a natural language interface to statistical analysis via Claude Code,
**so that** I can describe my research questions in plain language and receive executable code with interpretable results without mastering R or Python syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Oracle prompt template file created (`prompts/oracle_v1.0.md`) accepting natural language research questions (e.g., "What is the pooled effect size?", "Is there significant heterogeneity?", "Do effects differ by study quality?")
2. Prompt generates statistical analysis code for common Meta-analysis operations: pooled effect calculation (fixed-effect and random-effects models), heterogeneity assessment (I¬≤ statistic, Q-test), subgroup analysis, forest plot generation
3. Template supports both R (using `metafor` package) and Python (using `meta` or custom code) output‚Äîuser specifies preferred language
4. Generated code includes inline comments explaining each step and statistical concept (pedagogical approach for learning users)
5. Prompt instructs AI to interpret results in accessible language: "The pooled effect size is X (95% CI: Y-Z), indicating a [small/medium/large] [positive/negative] effect. Heterogeneity is [low/moderate/high] (I¬≤=W%), suggesting..."
6. Instructions for handling data quality flags included: Oracle should note when analysis includes high proportion of üü° or üî¥ labeled data and recommend sensitivity analyses
7. Usage instructions provided (`docs/oracle-usage.md`) with example research questions and expected code outputs
8. Version metadata and Claude model compatibility noted

## Project Structure Notes

- Oracle prompt template should be stored at `prompts/oracle/oracle_v1.0.md` following the established prompt template organization pattern. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Usage documentation should follow the established pattern from Compiler usage guide (`docs/compiler-usage.md`) and be stored at `docs/oracle-usage.md`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Example code outputs should be saved to `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/` to maintain consistency with sample project structure. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- CHANGELOG documentation should be maintained in `prompts/oracle/CHANGELOG.md` following semantic versioning practices established for Microscope and Compiler. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.3 completed testing of Compiler v1.0 with validation artifacts including gold standard data cards and compiled CSV samples. These validated datasets serve as test inputs for Oracle development and testing. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#completion-notes-list]
- Story 2.3 QA review identified gaps: automation needs and scale testing. Oracle v1.0 will not directly address these but should be designed with performance considerations for future optimization. [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#qa-results]
- Context window testing showed compiled datasets are manageable within Claude's limits for 4-10 cards; Oracle should handle compiled CSV inputs of similar scale (10-20 rows typical for initial meta-analyses). [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.2 established Compiler v1.0 with quality summary generation; Oracle should leverage this structured quality output for data quality flag handling. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.create-compiler-v1-prompt-template.md#completion-notes-list]

### Data Models

- **CompiledDataset** model provides input structure: expects CSV with columns like study_id, authors, year, effect_size, confidence_interval_lower/upper, quality_score, source_color_label. Oracle must generate code that reads this exact schema. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-4-compileddataset-ÁºñËØëÊï∞ÊçÆ]
- **Analysis** model (Model 6) is the output structure: includes `research_question` (natural language input), `language` (r or python), `code` (generated script), and `interpretation` (AI-generated textual results explanation). Oracle template should guide generation of all these fields. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-6-analysis-ÁªüËÆ°ÂàÜÊûê]
- **DataPoint** model defines three-color source labels (üü¢/üü°/üî¥) in `source_color_label` column of compiled CSV; Oracle must reference these when flagging data quality concerns in sensitivity analysis recommendations. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-2-datapoint-Êï∞ÊçÆÁÇπ]
- **PromptTemplate** model (Model 5) specifies that Oracle prompt must include version field (e.g., oracle_v1.0), compatible_models list (e.g., ["claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "claude-opus"]), and support semantic versioning. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-5-prompttemplate-prompt-Ê®°Êùø]

### API Specifications

- Claude Code is the execution environment for Oracle v1.0 prompt; template will be manually invoked by users via copy-paste into Claude Code sessions (MVP approach). No direct API integration required for v1.0. [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#api-1-claude-code-ÂÜÖÁΩÆ-ai-Ê®°ÂûãË∞ÉÁî®]
- Future CROS phases may integrate with Claude Code via CLI or MCP Server, but v1.0 assumes manual execution model consistent with Microscope and Compiler approach. [Source: docs/architecture/external-apis.md#api-1-claude-code-ÂÜÖÁΩÆ-ai-Ê®°ÂûãË∞ÉÁî®]

### Component Specifications

- **Oracle Analysis Generator** (Component 5) is the logical component; Oracle v1.0 prompt template is the MVP implementation of this component's functionality via prompt-based AI instruction. Template should guide AI to fulfill interfaces: `generate_analysis_code(question, dataset_path, language)` and `interpret_results()`. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#component-5-oracle-analysis-generator]
- **Prompt Template Manager** (Component 1) will eventually load Oracle prompts; template versioning must follow naming pattern: `oracle_v1.0.md`, `oracle_v1.1.md`, etc. Include version metadata in template for future automated detection. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#component-1-prompt-template-manager]
- Template should assume users provide compiled CSV path as input; generated code should robustly handle CSV loading (use `readr::read_csv()` for R, `pandas.read_csv()` for Python) with error handling for file not found scenarios. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#component-3-schema-validator]

- **Usage guide:** `docs/oracle-usage.md` ‚Äî document example research questions and walkthrough of how to use Oracle with compiled datasets. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- **Example outputs directory:** `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/` ‚Äî store sample R and Python code outputs generated by Oracle for reference. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- **Changelog:** `prompts/oracle/CHANGELOG.md` ‚Äî track version history and changes (initialize with v1.0 release notes). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- **Compiled data inputs:** `examples/sample_meta_analysis/compiled/` ‚Äî use gold standard compiled CSV from Story 2.3 as test input (e.g., `test_4_gold_standards_2025-10-23.csv`). [Source: docs/stories/2.3.test-compiler-with-data-cards-from-epic-1.md#dev-notes]

### Testing

- Manual verification approach appropriate for MVP stage; manually invoke Oracle template with example research questions and validate R/Python code generation for correctness. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Test with at least 5 common meta-analysis research questions covering: pooled effect size calculation, heterogeneity assessment, subgroup analysis, and forest plot generation. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.create-oracle-v1-prompt-template.md#acceptance-criteria]
- Validate generated code by reviewing for: (1) Correct library imports with installation instructions, (2) Proper CSV input handling, (3) Statistical calculations match expected meta-analysis formulas, (4) Output format matches interpretation pattern. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]
- Generate and store example outputs in `examples/sample_meta_analysis/analyses/` directory with both R and Python variants for same research question to demonstrate multi-language support. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree]
- Cross-platform testing consideration: Generated Python code must use `pathlib.Path` for file paths, not hard-coded OS-specific paths; R code should use relative paths. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-7-Ë∑ØÂæÑÂøÖÈ°ªË∑®Âπ≥Âè∞ÂÖºÂÆπ]

### Technical Constraints

- **Language support:** Template must clearly indicate how to request R vs. Python output; suggested approach is "Generate R code" or "Generate Python code" as modifier to research question. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.create-oracle-v1-prompt-template.md#acceptance-criteria]
- **Package dependencies:** R code must specify required packages (`metafor`, `readr`, `ggplot2` for forest plots). Python code should specify packages (`pandas`, `numpy`, `meta` or custom implementation, `matplotlib` for visualizations). Template must instruct to include installation instructions in generated code. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#rule-6-ÁîüÊàêÁöÑ‰ª£Á†ÅÂøÖÈ°ªËá™ÂåÖÂê´]
- **Data quality flag handling:** Generated code should accept `source_color_label` column from compiled CSV; when analysis includes >20% üü° or üî¥ labels, recommend sensitivity analyses (rerun with üü¢ only) to assess robustness. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.create-oracle-v1-prompt-template.md#acceptance-criteria]
- **Semantic versioning:** Template version must follow SemVer format (v1.0, v1.1, etc.); initialize as v1.0. Update version in CHANGELOG.md when revisions are made. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-5-prompttemplate-prompt-Ê®°Êùø]
- **Model compatibility:** Document compatible Claude models in template metadata (e.g., "Tested with: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"); include fallback guidance if users have different model versions. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#model-5-prompttemplate-prompt-Ê®°Êùø]
- **Code pedagogical quality:** Generated code must include inline comments explaining statistical concepts (e.g., "# Fixed-effect model assumes same underlying effect across studies"). This supports learning users without statistical background. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.create-oracle-v1-prompt-template.md#acceptance-criteria]
