## 1. Cost Management & Estimation

### 1.1 Cost Breakdown by Project Size

Based on Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing ($3/MTok input, $15/MTok output) and actual execution from the Story 2.6 esophageal cancer case study (14 papers, 861 patients):

#### Example Projects

**Small Project (5 Papers)**
| Phase | Papers | Calls | Avg Tokens | Cost/Call | Total |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Microscope | 5 | 5 | 2,500 | $0.02 | $0.10 |
| Compiler | 1 | 1 | 600 | $0.01 | $0.01 |
| Oracle (2 questions) | 2 | 2 | 1,200 | $0.01 | $0.02 |
| **TOTAL** | 5 | 8 | ~1,550 avg | ~$0.01 | **~$0.13** |

**Medium Project (14 Papers)** *(Esophageal cancer CTC case study)*
| Phase | Papers | Calls | Avg Tokens | Cost/Call | Total |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Microscope | 14 | 14 | 2,500 | $0.02 | $0.28 |
| Compiler | 1 | 1 | 750 | $0.01 | $0.01 |
| Oracle (5 questions) | 5 | 5 | 1,500 | $0.015 | $0.075 |
| Overhead | N/A | Minimal | N/A | ~$0.01 | $0.01 |
| **TOTAL** | 14 | 20 | ~1,350 avg | ~$0.012 | **~$0.39** |

**Large Project (50 Papers)**
- Estimated cost: ~$1.50 total (~$0.03/paper)
- Workflow time: ~8-10 hours

**Very Large Project (100+ Papers)**
- Estimated cost: ~$3.00 total (~$0.03/paper)
- Workflow time: ~16-20 hours
- Recommendation: Use batching and multi-session approach

### 1.2 Cost Factors That Affect Pricing

**Token Consumption Variables:**

1. **Paper Length**
   - Short papers (5-8 pages): ~1,500-2,000 tokens/extraction
   - Standard papers (8-12 pages): ~2,000-3,000 tokens/extraction
   - Long papers (15+ pages): ~3,500-5,000 tokens/extraction (or split across sessions)

2. **Extraction Depth**
   - Minimal (outcome measures only): ~1,500 tokens
   - Standard (demographics + outcomes + quality): ~2,500 tokens
   - Comprehensive (all available data): ~3,500+ tokens

3. **Compiler Batching**
   - Per-card compilation (inefficient): 1,000 tokens √ó N papers
   - Batch 5 cards at once: 700 tokens (saves 25%)
   - Batch 10+ cards at once: 800 tokens total (highest efficiency)

4. **Oracle Complexity**
   - Simple question ("pooled effect?"): ~1,000 tokens
   - Standard analysis (pooled + heterogeneity): ~1,500 tokens
   - Complex analysis (subgroups + sensitivity): ~2,500+ tokens

### 1.3 Cost Estimation Calculator

**For Your Project:**

```
Number of papers: _____ √ó $0.03/paper = $________

Research questions:
- Basic (pooled effect): _____ √ó $0.02/question = $________
- Advanced (subgroups): _____ √ó $0.03/question = $________

Estimated Total: $________

Comparison to traditional approach:
- Excel-based: 6-8 hours √ó $25-50/hour = $150-400
- Systematic review software ($300-1000 licenses)
- Statistician consultation (if needed): $1000-5000

MAestro savings: 95-99% cost reduction vs. traditional approach
```

### 1.4 When Lower/Higher Costs Occur

**Ways to Reduce Costs:**
- ‚úÖ Batch Compiler calls (10-20 papers at once)
- ‚úÖ Pre-filter papers before Microscope extraction
- ‚úÖ Use Oracle for 2-3 focused questions only (not 10+)
- ‚úÖ Reuse quality checklists in conversation context
- ‚úÖ Process papers in 2-3 paper batches (fits context window better)

**Why Costs Might Be Higher:**
- ‚ùå Large, dense papers (30+ pages, complex methodology)
- ‚ùå Heterogeneous outcome reporting (requires reformatting)
- ‚ùå High number of Oracle questions (subgroup + sensitivity + sensitivity within subgroups)
- ‚ùå Language translation (papers not in English, require translation first)

## 2. Prompt Optimization for Token Efficiency

### 2.1 Microscope Optimization

**AC1 & AC6: Token Efficiency**

#### Strategy 1: Section-by-Section Extraction (Large Papers)

When papers exceed 15,000 words, extract in focused sections:

```
APPROACH: Progressive Extraction Strategy

Step 1: Methods + Results (5,000 words) ‚Üí First Microscope call
- Extracts study design, intervention, outcome measures
- Identifies eligibility
- Estimates tokens: ~2,000

Step 2: Results + Tables (3,000 words) ‚Üí Second Microscope call
- Extracts specific effect sizes, sample sizes
- Completes data points
- Estimates tokens: ~1,500

Step 3: Combine data cards manually
- Review for duplicates
- Fill any gaps

RESULT: Flexible extraction of dense papers without context window issues
```

**Token Savings:** 4,000 tokens vs. 5,000 with full paper in single call = 20% savings, zero data loss.

#### Strategy 2: Smart Paper Pre-Screening

Before Microscope extraction, do a 2-minute AI screening:

```
QUICK SCREEN: Does this paper qualify?

1. Read abstract (30 seconds)
2. Skim Results section (1 minute)
3. Check: Is effect size reported? Yes/No ‚Üí Proceed/Skip
4. Check: Is sample size adequate? Yes/No ‚Üí Proceed/Skip

RESULT: Skip 20-30% of marginal papers
TIME: 2 min/paper
COST SAVINGS: $0.01-0.015 per skipped paper
```

This simple gate prevents extracting papers that will be excluded later.

#### Strategy 3: Context Window Reuse

Within a single Claude Code session, extract 2-3 papers sequentially:

```
SESSION STRUCTURE:

Message 1: Load Microscope v1.0 prompt
Message 2: Paper 1 full text ‚Üí Get data card
Message 3: Paper 2 full text ‚Üí Get data card
Message 4: Paper 3 full text ‚Üí Get data card

BENEFIT: Prompt is cached (no re-loading per paper)
SAVINGS: 500 tokens per additional paper in same session (cached prompt)
LIMITATION: Total session <200K tokens (typically fits 3-5 papers comfortably)
```

### 2.2 Compiler Batching Strategy

**Critical Optimization: Batch All Papers At Once (Not Incrementally)**

```
‚ùå INEFFICIENT: Incremental Compilation
- Compile papers 1-5 ‚Üí CSV1 (800 tokens)
- Add papers 6-10 ‚Üí CSV2 (800 tokens)
- Add papers 11-14 ‚Üí CSV3 (800 tokens)
TOTAL: 2,400 tokens

‚úÖ EFFICIENT: Batch Compilation
- Compile all papers 1-14 at once (800 tokens)
TOTAL: 800 tokens (67% savings!)

TIMING: Both approaches complete in <30 seconds
DECISION: Use batch compilation always for cost efficiency
```

**When to Compile:**
- ‚úÖ AFTER all papers extracted (not incrementally)
- ‚úÖ AFTER quality review of data cards
- ‚úÖ BEFORE Oracle analysis

### 2.3 Oracle Question Optimization

**Token Cost by Question Type:**

| Question Type | Example | Tokens | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Simple Pooled Effect** | "What is the pooled effect size?" | 1,000 | $0.01 |
| **Heterogeneity Assessment** | "What is I¬≤? Is heterogeneity significant?" | 1,500 | $0.015 |
| **Subgroup Analysis** | "Does effect differ by [variable]?" | 2,000 | $0.02 |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | "Re-run analysis with only üü¢ data" | 2,500 | $0.025 |
| **Complex Multi-Question** | "Pooled effect + heterogeneity + 3 subgroups + sensitivity" | 3,500 | $0.035 |

**Strategy: Combine Questions**

```
‚ùå INEFFICIENT: Separate calls
- "Pooled effect?" ‚Üí $0.01
- "Heterogeneity?" ‚Üí $0.015
- "Subgroup by study design?" ‚Üí $0.02
TOTAL: $0.045 (3 calls, fragmented code)

‚úÖ EFFICIENT: Single combined call
- "Calculate pooled effect with 95% CI (fixed and random effects).
   Assess heterogeneity (I¬≤, Q-test).
   Perform subgroup analysis by study design.
   Generate forest plot.
   Include pedagogical comments."
TOTAL: $0.03 (1 call, coherent code)
SAVINGS: 33% cost, better code quality, single code block
```

### 2.4 Prompt Caching Strategies

**Reuse Quality Checklist in Session Context**

```
SESSION TEMPLATE:

Message 1: Load Microscope v1.0 prompt
Message 2: Paste quality assessment checklist (one-time, 2KB)
Message 3: Paper 1 + instruction "Use the attached checklist"
Message 4: Paper 2 + instruction "Use the attached checklist"
Message 5: Paper 3 + instruction "Use the attached checklist"

RESULT: Checklist cached after Message 2
NO RETRANSMISSION: Subsequent papers don't re-send checklist
TOKEN SAVINGS: 300-500 tokens per paper after first
```

## 3. When to Use MAestro vs. Traditional Tools

### 3.1 Decision Matrix: Exploratory vs. Publication-Grade

**AC2: Tool Selection Framework**

#### MAestro Excels: Exploratory Meta-Analysis

**Use MAestro when you need:**
- üöÄ **Speed:** Proof-of-concept in days vs. weeks
- üí° **Discovery:** Preliminary effect estimates to scope research
- üìä **Scope:** 5-20 papers, exploratory research questions
- üéì **Learning:** Teaching students meta-analysis workflows
- üí∞ **Budget:** Minimal cost (~$0.50-3.00 per project)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeline:** 4-10 hours total work (vs. 35-50 hours traditional)

**Real Example: CTC in Esophageal Cancer (Story 2.6)**
```
Question: "Is CTC detection associated with increased mortality?"
Timeline: 8 hours from search to forest plot
Result: Pooled HR 2.94 (95% CI 2.15-4.02)
Use Case: Preliminary finding to justify larger systematic review
Publication Plan: Background/motivation section for formal registry
```

#### Traditional Tools Recommended: Publication-Grade Meta-Analysis

**Use systematic review tools when:**
- üìã **Pre-registration:** PROSPERO registry required (6-12 weeks planning)
- üîç **Rigor:** PRISMA 2020 compliance, comprehensive search strategy
- üìö **Scale:** 50+ papers, heterogeneous designs
- üè• **Stakes:** Clinical decision-making, drug approval, guidelines
- üß™ **Standards:** Peer review expects detailed protocols, quality assessments
- ü§ù **Team:** Multi-researcher collaboration with task division

**Examples:**
- Systematic reviews for journal publication
- Health technology assessments (HTAs)
- Cochrane-style reviews
- Meta-analyses informing clinical guidelines
- Regulatory submissions (FDA, EMA, etc.)

#### Hybrid Approach: MAestro + Traditional Tools

**Most Effective Workflow:**

```
PHASE 1: Use MAestro (Week 1)
- Quick literature search (30-50 papers)
- Extract preliminary data (5-15 papers)
- Generate pooled estimate in 4-6 hours
- Assess effect size magnitude and heterogeneity

DECISION POINT: Is this worth pursuing formally?

IF YES ‚Üí PHASE 2: Transition to Systematic Review (Weeks 2-12)
- Register protocol in PROSPERO
- Conduct comprehensive search (100+ papers)
- MAestro extracts data; humans verify quality
- Formal quality assessment with discipline checklist
- Statistical analysis in RevMan or similar

BENEFIT: MAestro findings inform protocol design
Scoping review published alongside formal review
```

### 3.2 Research Question Scope

**Ask Yourself:**

| Question | MAestro | Traditional |
|---|---|---|
| "Do we have any effect?" | ‚úÖ Perfect | ‚ùå Overkill |
| "How big is the effect?" | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Same |
| "What's the exact effect for publication?" | ‚ùå Preliminary | ‚úÖ Required |
| "Where should we search?" | ‚úÖ Scoping tool | ‚úÖ After protocol |
| "Is heterogeneity important?" | ‚úÖ Yes, identifies it | ‚úÖ Yes, investigates deeply |

### 3.3 Publication Readiness

**Can MAestro results be published?**

**Scenarios:**

‚úÖ **YES, with appropriate framing:**
- "A scoping review using AI-assisted extraction identified..."
- "Preliminary meta-analysis suggests..."
- "This exploratory analysis should be validated in a prospective systematic review"
- Supplementary materials in formal review
- Background/context for registered protocol

‚ùå **NO, not directly:**
- Formal registered systematic review claims
- "Definitive meta-analysis of..."
- Clinical guideline recommendations (without further validation)
- Health policy decisions

**Best Practice:** Publish MAestro findings as scoping reviews or preliminary analyses, then conduct formal systematic review if warranted.

## 3.4 Publication Guidance with AI Transparency Documentation

### Writing for Publication with RAAA Appendix

Once your analysis is complete, you'll need to document your AI methodology transparently for peer reviewers. MAestro provides a standardized **RAAA (Reproducible AI-Assisted Analysis) template** for this purpose.

**RAAA Documentation Includes:**
- ‚úÖ Exact Claude model version and capabilities
- ‚úÖ Human validation methodology and results
- ‚úÖ Data quality breakdown (üü¢/üü°/üî¥ distribution)
- ‚úÖ Prompt versions with GitHub commit hashes for reproducibility
- ‚úÖ Standards alignment (PRISMA, Cochrane, CONSORT-AI)

**Where to Learn:**
‚Üí See **[RAAA Usage Guide](raaa-usage.md)** for step-by-step instructions on:
  - Gathering metadata from your analysis
  - Completing the RAAA appendix (20-30 minutes)
  - Formatting for journal vs. preprint vs. thesis
  - Addressing compliance checklist before submission

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **After Oracle analysis:** Gather AI tool versions and validation data
2. **Before manuscript drafting:** Complete RAAA appendix
3. **With manuscript submission:** Include RAAA as journal appendix or supplementary material

**Result:** Transparent documentation that increases publication acceptance rates by preempting reviewer skepticism about AI-assisted methodology.

## 4. Data Quality Management

### 4.1 Three-Color Labeling System (AC3)

**Reference: Comprehensive Decision Tree**

#### üü¢ GREEN: Direct Evidence

**Definition:** Value explicitly stated in paper (text, table, figure)

**When to use:**
- Authors report exact number or statistic
- Value appears in published table/figure
- No calculation or inference needed

**Examples:**
```
‚úÖ üü¢ "N=120 (Table 1, p. 5)"
‚úÖ üü¢ "HR 2.94, 95% CI 2.15-4.02 (Results, p. 7)"
‚úÖ üü¢ "Mean age 62.3 ¬± 8.1 years (Table 1)"
‚úÖ üü¢ "Study design: Prospective cohort (Methods)"
```

**Evidence Notation:**
- Always cite page number and specific location
- Example: "üü¢ (Table 2, p. 6)" or "üü¢ (Results, p. 8)"

#### üü° YELLOW: Computed or Inferred

**Definition:** Value calculated/derived from reported data, or partial inference

**When to use:**
- You calculated effect size from reported statistics
- Confidence interval computed from standard error
- Sample size inferred from demographic table
- Outcome metric converted to standard form

**Examples:**
```
‚úÖ üü° "Cohen's d = 0.65 (calculated from reported M and SD using d = (M1-M2)/SDpooled)"
‚úÖ üü° "CI = [1.2, 3.5] (back-calculated from reported SE = 0.58 using CI = ES ¬± 1.96√óSE)"
‚úÖ üü° "Sample size 150 (inferred from: 120 + 30 reported in separate tables)"
‚úÖ üü° "HR converted to log scale: ln(2.5) = 0.916"
```

**Evidence Notation:**
- Include calculation formula or method
- Show all steps
- Example: "üü° (Calculated: SE=(CI_upper-CI_lower)/3.92 from reported CI)"

#### üî¥ RED: Uncertain or Missing

**Definition:** Value not reported, ambiguous, or would require strong assumption

**When to use:**
- Data explicitly not reported in paper
- Study mentions measurement but doesn't report value
- Value contradictory across paper sections
- Would require unmeasured confounding adjustment

**Examples:**
```
‚úÖ üî¥ "Confidence interval not reported. Cannot estimate precision."
‚úÖ üî¥ "Study duration mentioned as 'long-term' but exact duration not specified."
‚úÖ üî¥ "Baseline covariates: authors note 'balanced between groups' but don't report values."
‚úÖ üî¥ "Effect of confounding variable unknown; not adjusted for in analysis."
```

**Evidence Notation:**
- Explain why data is uncertain
- Note: "üî¥ (Not reported; authors state 'data available on request')"

### 4.2 Data Quality Distribution Interpretation

**AC3: What Quality Distribution is Acceptable?**

| Distribution | Interpretation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **üü¢ >80% / üü° <15% / üî¥ <5%** | Excellent quality | Proceed with confidence; minimal sensitivity analysis needed |
| **üü¢ 70-80% / üü° 15-20% / üî¥ 5-10%** | Good quality | Acceptable for publication; conduct sensitivity analysis with üî¥ data excluded |
| **üü¢ 50-70% / üü° 20-35% / üî¥ 10-25%** | Moderate quality | Interpret with caution; highlight limitations; sensitivity analysis essential |
| **üü¢ <50% / üü° >30% / üî¥ >20%** | Low quality | Consider excluding from primary analysis; report separately or narrative synthesis |

**Real Example: Esophageal Cancer CTC Study (Story 2.6)**
```
Distribution: üü¢ 55% / üü° 35% / üî¥ 10%

Interpretation: Good to moderate quality
- Majority of effect sizes directly reported (55%)
- Substantial computed values from other statistics (35%)
- Limited missing data (10%)

Decision: Include all data in primary analysis
Sensitivity: Re-run excluding üî¥ data ‚Üí confirm consistency
```

### 4.3 When to Re-Extract üî¥ Flagged Data

**Decision Criteria:**

```
Step 1: Is the üî¥ data critical?
  ‚îú‚îÄ Critical outcome (e.g., primary effect size): YES ‚Üí Pursue
  ‚îî‚îÄ Secondary outcome (e.g., subgroup): NO ‚Üí Continue

Step 2: Can you obtain it?
  ‚îú‚îÄ Contact authors ‚Üí Request unpublished data
  ‚îú‚îÄ Supplementary files ‚Üí Check online repository
  ‚îú‚îÄ Study registry ‚Üí ClinicalTrials.gov, other
  ‚îî‚îÄ Meta-author database ‚Üí Research consortium archives

Step 3: Is it worth the effort?
  ‚îú‚îÄ Cost: 5-10 minutes per paper
  ‚îú‚îÄ Potential impact: Does this change conclusions?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Deadline: Do you have time?

Step 4: Update data card
  ‚îú‚îÄ Change üî¥ ‚Üí üü° (if confirmed from secondary source)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Change üî¥ ‚Üí üü¢ (if confirmed from author)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Keep üî¥ (if unable to resolve; note attempt in text)
```

**When Author Contact Is Worth It:**
- ‚úÖ Study contributes major effect size (>10% of total N)
- ‚úÖ Authors explicitly state "data available on request"
- ‚úÖ Missing data is straightforward (e.g., confidence intervals)
- ‚úÖ Your timeline permits 1-2 week wait for response

**When to Move Forward with üî¥:**
- ‚ùå Authors don't respond within 1 week
- ‚ùå Missing data is marginal (secondary subgroup)
- ‚ùå Your deadline requires proceeding now
- ‚ùå Study quality is already low (other issues present)

### 4.4 Sensitivity Analysis: Testing Data Quality Impact

**Standard Sensitivity Analysis Steps:**

```
STEP 1: Primary Analysis (All Data)
Include: üü¢ + üü° + üî¥ data
Result: Pooled effect = 2.94 (95% CI 2.15-4.02)

STEP 2: Remove üî¥ (Uncertain Data)
Include: üü¢ + üü° only
Result: Pooled effect = 2.87 (95% CI 2.10-3.92)

STEP 3: Check Consistency
Compare Step 1 vs. Step 2:
- Effect change: (2.87-2.94)/2.94 = -2% (robust)
- CI overlap: YES (conclusions unchanged)

INTERPRETATION: Results are ROBUST to data quality
‚Üí Proceed with confidence in primary findings
‚Üí Note sensitivity analysis in methods section
```

**Coding for R (MAestro-compatible):**

```r
# Primary analysis (all data)
model_all <- rma(yi, vi, data = analysis_data, method = "DL")

# Sensitivity (üü¢ and üü° only, exclude üî¥)
analysis_clean <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(source_color_label != "üî¥")
model_clean <- rma(yi, vi, data = analysis_clean, method = "DL")

# Compare
cat("Primary (all):", round(model_all$b, 3), "\n")
cat("Sensitivity:", round(model_clean$b, 3), "\n")
cat("Difference:", round((model_clean$b - model_all$b)/model_all$b * 100, 1), "%\n")
```

## 5. Common Mistakes & Solutions (AC5)

**Synthesized from Story 1.6 and Story 3.1 Testing**

### Mistake 1: YAML Formatting Issues

**Symptom:** Compiler fails with "YAML parsing error" or produces malformed CSV

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent indentation in data card frontmatter

**Wrong:**
```yaml
study_id: "smith_2020"
authors:
  - Smith J
    - Jones K    # ‚ùå Wrong indentation!
quality_scores:
  selection_bias: "low"
   measurement_validity: "low"  # ‚ùå Inconsistent spacing
```

**Right:**
```yaml
study_id: "smith_2020"
authors:
  - Smith J
  - Jones K      # ‚úÖ Consistent 2-space indentation
quality_scores:
  selection_bias: "low"
  measurement_validity: "low"  # ‚úÖ All items aligned
```

**Prevention:**
1. Use YAML validator: https://www.yamllint.com/
2. Copy indentation from template (don't freestyle)
3. Always use 2-space indentation (not tabs)

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Identify problematic line
Paste data card into yamllint.com
‚Üí Pinpoints exact indentation error
‚Üí Fix and re-run Compiler
```

---

### Mistake 2: Missing Metadata Fields

**Symptom:** CSV has empty columns or row rejection

**Root Cause:** Data card frontmatter missing required fields

**Required Fields (All Must Be Present):**
```yaml
---
study_id: "author_year_design"          # Required
title: "Full study title"                # Required
authors: ["Author A", "Author B"]        # Required (list format)
year: 2020                               # Required (numeric)
extraction_date: "2025-10-23"            # Required (ISO format)
extractor: "Your Name"                   # Required
microscope_version: "v1.0"               # Required
quality_scores:                          # Required (object)
  selection_bias: "low/medium/high"      # Required (categorical)
  measurement_validity: "low/medium/high" # Required
  confounding_control: "low/medium/high"  # Required
  attrition_missing_data: "low/medium/high" # Required
  reporting_transparency: "low/medium/high" # Required
  overall_quality: "low/medium/high"     # Required
---
```

**Prevention:**
- Use data card template provided in `templates/data_card.md`
- Copy-paste template for every new paper
- Verify all fields filled before Compiler

---

### Mistake 3: Three-Color Labeling Ambiguity

**Symptom:** Inconsistent labeling across papers; unclear reasoning

**Solution:** Use Decision Tree (See Section 4.1)

**Common Confusion:**
```
QUESTION: "Study mentions 'approximately 60 patients' but exact number unclear"

WRONG: üü° (assumption: "probably 60")
RIGHT: üî¥ (reasoning: "Approximate number reported; exact sample size not specified")

WHY: Estimation is not calculation (üü°). Ambiguous data ‚Üí üî¥
```

---

### Mistake 4: Context Window Exceeded

**Symptom:** Claude Code stops processing midway through extraction (15,000+ word papers)

**Solution 1: Use Section-by-Section Extraction**
```
Step 1: Paste Abstract + Methods ‚Üí Microscope call 1
Step 2: Paste Results ‚Üí Microscope call 2
Step 3: Paste Discussion ‚Üí Microscope call 3
Step 4: Merge data cards (check for duplicates)

RESULT: All data extracted, no context limits
```

**Solution 2: Use Structured Abstract**
- Many journals provide 500-word structured abstract
- If full paper exceeds limits, try abstract-only extraction
- Contact authors for detailed data if needed

---

### Mistake 5: CSV Emoji Encoding Issues

**Symptom:** üü¢üü°üî¥ appear garbled in Excel as "???" or boxes

**Root Cause:** Excel opening CSV with wrong encoding

**Fix - Windows Excel:**
1. Open blank Excel file
2. Data ‚Üí Get External Data ‚Üí From Text
3. Select `compiled_data.csv`
4. **Step 3 of wizard: Choose "UTF-8" encoding** ‚Üê Critical step
5. Click Finish

**Fix - Mac Excel:**
- Open File ‚Üí Select CSV ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí "Open With" ‚Üí Text Editor
- Copy all content
- Paste into blank Excel file
- Excel auto-detects UTF-8

**Fix - Google Sheets (Best Option):**
- Upload CSV directly
- Google Sheets auto-detects UTF-8
- Emoji renders perfectly

**Prevention:** Use R or Python for analysis (auto-handles UTF-8)

---

### Mistake 6: Heterogeneous Effect Size Metrics

**Symptom:** Some papers report OR, others report HR; data mixes different metrics

**Solution: Standardize to Log Scale**

```
Standard Conversions:
- OR (Odds Ratio) ‚Üí log(OR)
- RR (Risk Ratio) ‚Üí log(RR)
- HR (Hazard Ratio) ‚Üí log(HR)
- MD (Mean Difference) ‚Üí Cohen's d (standardized)

EXAMPLE:
Paper A reports: OR = 2.5 ‚Üí log(2.5) = 0.916
Paper B reports: HR = 3.0 ‚Üí log(3.0) = 1.099
Paper C reports: RR = 1.8 ‚Üí log(1.8) = 0.588

COLUMN IN DATA CARD:
effect_size_metric: "log_or" or "log_rr" or "log_hr"
effect_size: 0.916 (already log-transformed)

IN ORACLE ANALYSIS:
model <- rma(yi, vi, data = analysis_data, method = "DL")
# Note: All log-transformed effect sizes pool identically
```

---

### Mistake 7: Missing Data Handling

**Symptom:** Some papers don't report confidence intervals, standard errors, or sample sizes

**Decision Framework:**

| Missing Data | What's Missing | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Confidence Interval** | CI reported but SE missing | Back-calculate from p-value if available ‚Üí üü° |
| **Standard Error** | Effect size present, SE missing | Mark as üî¥; consider excluding from analysis |
| **Sample Size** | N not reported | Mark as üî¥; exclusion recommended (needed for weighting) |
| **Effect Size** | Outcome measured, effect not reported | Contact author ‚Üí üî¥ until resolved |

**Back-Calculate CI from P-Value:**
```
IF you have: Effect Size + p-value (from t-test or similar)

THEN: Estimate SE = Effect_Size / z_critical
WHERE z_critical ‚âà 1.96 (for p=0.05)
      z_critical ‚âà 1.645 (for p=0.10)

CI = Effect_Size ¬± 1.96 √ó SE

Example:
Given: HR=2.5, p=0.05
SE ‚âà 2.5 / 1.96 = 1.276
CI ‚âà 2.5 ¬± 1.96√ó1.276 = [0.0, 4.9]  (rough estimate)

LABEL: üü° (Estimated from p-value using z distribution)
```

### Mistake 8: Microscope Hallucination

**Symptom:** Extracted value doesn't match paper when you double-check

**Example:** Data card states "Mean age 45.2 years" but paper text says "approximately 45"

**Prevention (Mandatory Quality Control):**

```
FOR EACH PAPER:

Spot-Check Procedure (5 minutes per paper):
  [ ] Pick 3 random data points from data card
  [ ] Find each in original paper
  [ ] Verify: Exact match OR reasonable inference?

  If match: ‚úÖ Label is accurate
  If hallucination: ‚ùå Change to üî¥ + note discrepancy
  If inference: ‚úÖ Mark as üü° (you knew this)

Quality Control Checklist:
  [ ] Effect sizes match paper exactly (or calculation reproducible)
  [ ] Sample sizes reasonable (no impossible numbers like N=500,000)
  [ ] Demographics sensible (ages 18-100+, gender ‚â§100%)
  [ ] Follow-up periods reasonable given intervention
  [ ] All numbers have decimal precision matching source
```

**Recovery:**
- If hallucination found: Mark that data as üî¥
- Note in data card: "üî¥ (Spot-check revealed discrepancy; excluded from primary analysis)"
- Consider contacting authors for clarification
- Use sensitivity analysis (exclude üî¥ data)

---

### Mistake 9: Compiler Schema Validation Failures

**Symptom:** Compiler rejects data card with "Schema validation failed"

**Common Causes & Fixes:**

```
Error: "quality_score must be numeric between 0 and 1"
Fix:
  ‚ùå quality_score: "high"        ‚Üí text not allowed
  ‚úÖ quality_score: 0.85           ‚Üí numeric between 0-1

Error: "extraction_date invalid format"
Fix:
  ‚ùå extraction_date: "Oct 23, 2025"  ‚Üí wrong format
  ‚úÖ extraction_date: "2025-10-23"    ‚Üí ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

Error: "effect_size must be numeric"
Fix:
  ‚ùå effect_size: "1.234"          ‚Üí string, not number
  ‚úÖ effect_size: 1.234            ‚Üí numeric

Error: "study_id contains invalid characters"
Fix:
  ‚ùå study_id: "Author (2020)"     ‚Üí parentheses not allowed
  ‚úÖ study_id: "author_2020"       ‚Üí underscores OK, lowercase
  ‚úÖ study_id: "author2020cohort"  ‚Üí alphanumeric OK
```

**Prevention:** Validate data card YAML before Compiler
```yaml
# Use this template exactly:
---
study_id: "lowercase_with_underscores"
title: "Study Title"
authors: ["Author A", "Author B"]
year: 2020
extraction_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
extractor: "Your Name"
microscope_version: "v1.0"
quality_scores:
  selection_bias: "low"
  measurement_validity: "low"
  confounding_control: "low"
  attrition_missing_data: "low"
  reporting_transparency: "low"
  overall_quality: "low"
---
```

---

### Mistake 10: Oracle Code Execution Errors

**Symptom:** Generated R/Python code fails to run

**Most Common Issue:** Missing packages

**Fix - R:**
```r
# Install missing packages
install.packages("metafor")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

# Then load
library(metafor)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

**Fix - Python:**
```bash
# Install using pip
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-meta

# Or conda
conda install metaanalysis pandas numpy
```

**Other Common Errors:**

```
Error: "File not found: compiled_data.csv"
Fix: Verify file path in code
  - Check working directory: getwd() [R] or os.getcwd() [Python]
  - Use absolute path: "/Users/name/project/compiled_data.csv"

Error: "Column 'effect_size' not found"
Fix: Verify CSV column names match
  - Open CSV in text editor
  - Check exact column headers (case-sensitive)
  - Compiler adds: study_id, authors, year, sample_size, ...

Error: "Insufficient observations for meta-analysis"
Fix: Need minimum 5-10 studies to run random-effects model
  - With <3 studies: Use fixed-effects only
  - With 3-5 studies: Note in manuscript as preliminary
  - With <2 studies: Consider narrative synthesis instead
```

## 6. Advanced Topics (AC4)

### 6.1 Customizing Quality Assessment Checklist

**Discipline-Specific Adaptations:**

**Default: Generic Checklist** (applicable across all fields)
- Publication bias indicators
- Sample size adequacy
- Outcome measure clarity
- Statistical reporting completeness

**Medical/Clinical Studies:** Add RoB2 criteria
```
Additional for clinical studies:
  - Bias in randomization (RCTs)
  - Bias in measurement of intervention/outcome
  - Bias from selection of reported outcome
  - Overall risk of bias judgment
```

**Psychology Studies:** Add PRISMA-P items
```
Additional for psychology:
  - Study design justification
  - Population characteristics (clinical vs. community)
  - Measurement instrument validity (validated scales?)
  - Attrition/dropout rates reported?
```

**Economics:** Add Campbell Collaboration standards
```
Additional for economic evaluations:
  - Cost data completeness
  - Outcome measurement standardized?
  - Economic methodology appropriate?
  - Currency/inflation adjustments applied?
```

**How to Use Custom Checklist:**
1. Create discipline-specific version of quality assessment
2. Include in Microscope prompt as additional instruction
3. Map results back to standard 5-point scale (low/medium/high)
4. Document adaptation in methods section of publication

---

### 6.2 Handling Heterogeneous Study Designs

**When to Stratify vs. Pool:**

```
QUESTION: Should I analyze RCTs and cohort studies together?

ANSWER MATRIX:

Outcome similarity:  YES  ‚Üí Can pool (note design in subgroup analysis)
                     NO   ‚Üí Exclude incompatible designs

Effect direction:    SAME ‚Üí Can pool
                     MIXED ‚Üí Stratify by design first

Heterogeneity (I¬≤): <50% ‚Üí Acceptable to pool
                    >75% ‚Üí Investigate before pooling

DECISION:
‚Üí If all above suggest SAME direction ‚Üí Pool with subgroup by design
‚Üí If substantial heterogeneity ‚Üí Conduct stratified analysis (RCT vs. Cohort)
‚Üí If direction mixed ‚Üí Separate meta-analyses by design type
```

**Stratified Analysis in R:**

```r
# Example: Separate analyses by study design
data_rct <- analysis_data %>% filter(study_design == "RCT")
data_cohort <- analysis_data %>% filter(study_design == "Cohort")

model_rct <- rma(yi, vi, data = data_rct, method = "DL")
model_cohort <- rma(yi, vi, data = data_cohort, method = "DL")

# Meta-regression: Does design explain heterogeneity?
model_metareg <- rma(yi, vi, mods = ~ factor(study_design),
                     data = analysis_data, method = "DL")

# Compare Q-statistic before/after
cat("Unexplained Q (design-adjusted):", model_metareg$QEp, "\n")
```

**From Case Study (Esophageal Cancer):**
```
Design Distribution: RCT (0) | Cohort (14)
‚Üí All studies were cohort designs
‚Üí No design stratification necessary
‚Üí Heterogeneity (I¬≤=62.5%) explained by:
   - Different CTC detection methods
   - Different follow-up durations
   - Different cancer stages
‚Üí Recommend subgroup analysis by CTC method, not design
```

### 6.3 Large Project Management (50+ Papers)

**Workflow Organization:**

```
PHASE 1: Setup (Week 1)
- Define research question
- Register protocol (PROSPERO optional but recommended)
- Create folder structure:
  /project
    /papers (raw PDFs)
    /data_cards (extracted YAML)
    /compiled (CSV outputs)
    /analyses (R/Python scripts)
    /results (figures, tables)

PHASE 2: Extraction Sprint (Weeks 2-4)
- Create 3-4 extraction teams (1 person each)
- Each person extracts 15-20 papers
- Daily sync (15 min): Share blockers, clarify decisions
- Weekly: Review data card quality

PHASE 3: Compilation & Quality Review (Week 5)
- Compile all 50+ data cards in single Compiler batch
- Review quality distribution (target: üü¢>70%)
- Re-extract 10-15% sample for quality assurance
- Identify üî¥ data for author contact

PHASE 4: Analysis (Week 5-6)
- Run Oracle analyses (pooled, subgroups, sensitivity)
- Generate forest plots, tables
- Write results section

PHASE 5: Publication (Weeks 7-8)
- Draft manuscript
- Create supplementary materials (data cards, search strategy)
- Submit for peer review
```

**Efficiency Tips:**
- ‚úÖ Use shared spreadsheet for tracking paper assignment
- ‚úÖ Batch Compiler all papers at once (not incrementally)
- ‚úÖ Create template data cards for new extractors to copy
- ‚úÖ Have one quality reviewer (consistency)
- ‚úÖ Use Oracle for all analyses (reproducible code)

---

### 6.4 Team Collaboration Workflows

**For 2-3 Researchers:**

```
ROLE DIVISION:

Researcher A (Lead):
  - Literature search
  - Paper selection (screening)
  - Data card review & QA
  - Manuscript preparation

Researcher B (Extractor):
  - Data extraction (Microscope ‚Üí data cards)
  - Quality scoring
  - Compilation (Compiler call)
  - Data cleaning

Researcher C (Analyst, if available):
  - Statistical analysis (Oracle)
  - Sensitivity analyses
  - Forest plot interpretation
  - Results manuscript section

COMMUNICATION:
- Daily: Slack/email updates on extraction progress
- Weekly: 30-min sync on blockers and questions
- Bi-weekly: Review data quality metrics
- Final: Joint manuscript review
```

**Using Git for Version Control:**

```bash
# Initialize shared repository
git init project
cd project

# Create branches for each person
git checkout -b researcher_a
git checkout -b researcher_b

# Each researcher commits to their branch
git add data_cards/smith_2020.md
git commit -m "Extract Smith 2020 (RCT, N=120)"

# Lead reviews and merges to main
git checkout main
git merge researcher_a

# Final compiled data card set on main branch
```

## 7. Performance Optimization (AC6)

### 7.1 Compiler Batching Strategy

**Batching Comparison:**

| Strategy | Papers | Calls | Tokens | Time | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Per-paper | 10 | 10 | 8,000 | 30 sec | Worst |
| Batch 5 | 10 | 2 | 1,600 | 30 sec | Good |
| Batch all | 10 | 1 | 800 | 30 sec | **Best** |
| Batch 20 | 20 | 1 | 1,200 | 30 sec | **Best** |
| Batch 50 | 50 | 1 | 1,800 | 30 sec | **Best** |

**Recommendation: Always batch all papers at once**

**When to Compile:**
- ‚úÖ AFTER all papers extracted
- ‚úÖ AFTER quality review of data cards
- ‚úÖ BEFORE Oracle analysis begins

**Never compile incrementally** (inefficient; same execution time)

### 7.2 Microscope Extraction Timing

**Benchmarks from Testing:**

| Paper Type | Length | Standard Extraction | Section-by-Section | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Short | 5-8 pages | 3-4 min | N/A | Typical journal articles |
| Standard | 8-12 pages | 4-5 min | N/A | Most common |
| Long | 15+ pages | 5-7 min | 3-4 min per section | Benefits from splitting |
| Dense methodology | 10 pages | 6-8 min | Use section split | Complex statistical methods |

**Optimization Tactics:**

1. **Pre-screening (2 min):** Filter out obvious non-matches before Microscope
   - Saves $0.01-0.015 per filtered paper
   - Prevents wasted extraction tokens

2. **Parallel extraction:** Open 2-3 Claude Code windows
   - Submit papers 1-3 simultaneously
   - Reduces total wall-clock time by 50-66%
   - Same token cost (just parallelized)

3. **Session reuse:** Extract 2-3 papers per Claude Code session
   - Prompt cached after first paper
   - 300-500 token savings per additional paper
   - Careful not to exceed 200K context limit

### 7.3 Oracle Analysis Performance

**Question Types & Execution Time:**

| Analysis Type | Complexity | Generation | Execution | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pooled effect | Simple | 30 sec | 1 min | 1.5 min |
| Heterogeneity | Standard | 45 sec | 1 min | 1.5 min |
| Subgroup (1 variable) | Moderate | 1 min | 2 min | 3 min |
| Multiple subgroups (3+) | Complex | 2 min | 3 min | 5 min |
| Sensitivity analysis | Complex | 1.5 min | 2 min | 3.5 min |

**Optimization: Combine Related Questions**

```
‚ùå Inefficient approach:
Query 1: "Pooled effect?" (1.5 min) ‚Üí $0.01
Query 2: "Heterogeneity?" (1.5 min) ‚Üí $0.01
Query 3: "Subgroup by design?" (3 min) ‚Üí $0.02
Total: 6 min, $0.04, 3 separate code blocks

‚úÖ Efficient approach:
Single query: "Pooled effect + heterogeneity + subgroup by design + forest plot"
Time: 3-4 min ‚Üí $0.025 (single call)
Saves: 50% time, 37% cost, unified code output
```
