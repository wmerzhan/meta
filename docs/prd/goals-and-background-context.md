# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Validate core three-element workflow (Microscope, Compiler, Oracle) with 10+ researchers successfully completing end-to-end exploratory Meta-analyses across 3+ disciplines by Q2 2026
- Achieve 50% time reduction in data extraction phase compared to manual Excel-based workflows through conversation-driven automation
- Establish academic credibility through methodology paper publication in Meta-research journal and 3+ testimonials from established Meta-analysis methodologists by end of 2026
- Build sustainable open-source community with 100+ active users, 50+ GitHub stars, and 20+ community-contributed discipline modules by end of 2026
- Secure pathway to CROS (Conversational Research OS) development by validating technical feasibility and identifying funding source by Q4 2026
- Democratize Meta-analysis methodology by lowering barriers to entry for individual researchers, students, and small teams lacking specialized software or statistical support

## Background Context

Meta-analysis has become the gold standard for evidence-based decision making, yet conducting rigorous Meta-analyses remains an elite practice accessible to fewer than 10% of researchers who could benefit from these methods. Current tools (RevMan, Stata, Covidence) impose steep learning curves requiring weeks-to-months of training, demand expensive licenses ($1,500-$5,000+ annually), and enforce rigid workflows that consume 40-60% of project time on mechanical data processing tasks. This creates fundamental barriers: individual researchers and small teams lack resources for specialized software and dedicated statistical support, limiting accessibility and delaying rapid evidence synthesis in fast-moving fields.

MAestro reimagines Meta-analysis as a conversation-driven workflow built on three atomic tools that combine like building blocks: **Microscope** (deep single-paper analysis), **Compiler** (data aggregation across papers), and **Oracle** (natural language statistical interface). By leveraging Claude Code's capabilities through pure prompt-based workflows, MAestro positions itself as an "idea catalyst" rather than a "precision measurement instrument"â€”enabling exploratory Meta-analyses in days rather than weeks while maintaining transparency through innovative three-color source labeling (ðŸŸ¢ direct quote, ðŸŸ¡ computed inference, ðŸ”´ uncertain/missing) and data card microservice architecture. This local-first, Git-based approach meets researchers where they are (markdown, natural conversation) without requiring custom software development, delivering 80% of value for exploratory assessments with 20% of traditional complexity.
