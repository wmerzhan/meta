# Checklist Results Report

**PRD Validation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Overall Completeness:** 88% (Very Strong)
**Readiness:** ✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT

## Executive Summary

The MAestro PRD demonstrates exceptional strategic clarity and appropriate MVP scoping. Epic/story breakdown is well-sequenced with testable acceptance criteria. Minor recommendations for improvement are noted below, but none are blocking for architectural work.

## Validation Results

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Problem Definition & Context | PASS (95%) | Exceptionally clear problem statement from Brief |
| MVP Scope Definition | PASS (90%) | Minor CROS details could move to Phase 2 |
| User Experience Requirements | PASS (85%) | Terminal-first assumption flagged for validation |
| Functional Requirements | PASS (92%) | Excellent FR/NFR breakdown |
| Non-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL (75%) | Some targets stated as requirements (NFR2, NFR7) |
| Epic & Story Structure | PASS (95%) | Outstanding breakdown and sequencing |
| Technical Guidance | PASS (88%) | Strong guidance for architect |
| Cross-Functional Requirements | PASS (90%) | Well-covered |
| Clarity & Communication | PASS (93%) | Exceptionally well-written |

## Key Recommendations

**HIGH Priority:**
1. Rephrase NFR2 (90% accuracy) and NFR7 ($3-10 cost) as "validation targets" not absolute requirements
2. Add contingency to Story 3.4 if beta tester recruitment falls short (<5 testers)
3. Consider moving CROS technical details to separate Phase 2 document

**MEDIUM Priority:**
4. Add terminal-first UX validation with 2-3 non-technical users in Epic 1
5. Clarify Git integration as optional, provide "quick start without Git" path
6. Add three-color labeling validation to Story 1.6 with hallucination-prone test cases

**Scope Optimization (Optional):**
- Consider R-only for Oracle v1.0 (defer Python to v1.1)
- Git Integration Guide (Story 1.5) could be v1.1
- RAAA Appendix (Story 3.3) valuable but not blocking for beta testing

## Technical Risks for Architect

1. **Prompt stability across Claude model updates** - high risk, needs version pinning + fallback strategies
2. **Statistical code correctness** - AI-generated R/Python may have subtle bugs, needs validation framework
3. **Three-color labeling reliability** - core value prop depends on 90% flagging accuracy
4. **Context window limits** - some papers may exceed 200K tokens

## Timeline Assessment

- Epic 1: 2-4 weeks ✓ Realistic
- Epic 2: 3-5 weeks ✓ Realistic (Oracle is complex)
- Epic 3: 6-10 weeks ✓ Realistic (mostly beta testing wait time)
- **Total: 11-19 weeks (3-5 months)** - aligns with Brief projections

**Decision:** ✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT - Proceed with architectural design
