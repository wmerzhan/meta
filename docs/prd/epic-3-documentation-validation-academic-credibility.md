# Epic 3: Documentation, Validation & Academic Credibility

**Goal:** Enable community adoption and establish academic legitimacy by creating comprehensive Quick Start Guide with example workflow, developing Best Practices documentation for optimization and advanced usage, designing RAAA transparency appendix template for publication compliance, and conducting validation studies with 5-10 beta testers to verify 90% extraction accuracy and gather testimonials from the research community.

## Story 3.1: Create Quick Start Guide with Example Workflow

As a new user discovering MAestro,
I want a step-by-step tutorial that walks me through my first complete Meta-analysis,
so that I can go from zero to working analysis within 45 minutes without getting stuck or confused.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Quick Start Guide created (`docs/quickstart.md`) walking through complete workflow: project setup → extract data from 5 sample papers using Microscope → compile with Compiler → analyze with Oracle → interpret results
2. Guide uses concrete example from Epic 2 Story 2.6 end-to-end test (research question, actual papers, real results)
3. Every command and prompt shown explicitly with expected outputs (copy-paste ready)
4. Screenshots or terminal output examples included for key steps to set expectations
5. Time estimates provided for each phase (e.g., "Extracting one paper takes ~5 minutes")
6. Troubleshooting section addresses 5-10 most common failure modes from Epic 1-2 testing (format errors, context limits, missing fields)
7. Guide tested with at least 2 naive users (friends/colleagues unfamiliar with MAestro) to validate <45 minute time-to-first-value
8. Links to detailed documentation (data card format, prompt usage guides) provided for users wanting deeper understanding

## Story 3.2: Develop Best Practices Documentation

As a researcher using MAestro for a real Meta-analysis project,
I want guidance on optimizing workflows, managing costs, and handling edge cases,
so that I can use the tools efficiently and avoid common pitfalls that waste time or produce unreliable results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Best Practices document created (`docs/best-practices.md`) covering: prompt optimization for token efficiency, cost estimation and budgeting (~$3-10 per project), managing context window limits for long papers, discipline-specific adaptations, team collaboration workflows
2. Section on "When to Use MAestro vs. Traditional Tools" addresses exploratory vs. publication-grade Meta-analysis distinction, helps users understand appropriate use cases
3. Data quality management guidance: interpreting three-color labels, when to re-extract 🔴 flagged data, sensitivity analysis recommendations
4. Advanced topics included: customizing quality assessment checklist, handling heterogeneous study designs, managing large projects (50+ papers)
5. Common mistakes documented from Epic 1-2 testing with solutions (e.g., "Don't process papers in single long conversation—use separate sessions per paper")
6. Performance optimization tips: batching strategies, when to use Compiler incrementally vs. all-at-once
7. Links to community resources: where to ask questions, how to contribute discipline modules, how to report bugs
8. Document reviewed by at least one experienced Meta-analysis researcher for methodological accuracy

## Story 3.3: Design RAAA Transparency Appendix Template

As a researcher preparing to publish AI-assisted Meta-analysis,
I want a standardized template for documenting my AI usage transparently,
so that reviewers and readers can evaluate the rigor and reproducibility of my work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. RAAA (Reproducible AI-Assisted Analysis) Appendix template created (`templates/raaa_appendix.md`) with sections: AI Tools Used (Claude model version, MAestro prompt versions), Human Validation Steps (how data was verified), Data Quality Breakdown (percentage 🟢/🟡/🔴 labeled data), Prompts Used (full text or references to versioned prompts in MAestro repo)
2. Template includes example completed appendix from Epic 2 Story 2.6 end-to-end test
3. Guidance on adapting template for different publication venues (journal article appendix, preprint supplement, thesis chapter)
4. Checklist for transparency compliance: "Have you documented AI model version? Have you reported data quality metrics? Have you included validation procedures?"
5. Rationale section explains WHY transparency matters (academic credibility, reproducibility, ethical AI use in research)
6. Template reviewed by at least one Meta-analysis methodologist or journal editor for alignment with emerging reporting standards
7. Integration guidance: how to generate data quality breakdown from compiled dataset, how to reference MAestro prompts (GitHub commit hashes for version pinning)

## Story 3.4: Recruit and Onboard Beta Testers *(PREREQUISITE: Stories 3.1 & 3.2 MUST be completed first)*

As a solo founder ready to validate MVP with real users,
I want to recruit 5-10 beta testers from diverse research backgrounds,
so that I can gather empirical evidence of MAestro's value proposition and identify issues that solo testing missed.

**⚠️ CRITICAL DEPENDENCY**: This story CANNOT begin until Story 3.1 (Quick Start Guide) and Story 3.2 (Best Practices) are completed, as these are required for beta tester onboarding package. *(PO Validation: Critical Issue #5 - Onboarding Sequence)*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Beta tester recruitment outreach conducted: personal network, academic Twitter, relevant Reddit communities (r/AcademicPsychology, r/Scholar), Meta-analysis methodology mailing lists
2. Target diversity achieved: at least 3 different disciplines (medicine, psychology, education, social sciences, economics), mix of post-docs/students/junior faculty, mix of technical comfort levels
3. Selection criteria applied: willingness to commit 10-20 hours over 4-6 weeks, has active Meta-analysis project or willing to conduct exploratory review, comfortable providing detailed feedback
4. Onboarding package created: Quick Start Guide (Story 3.1), Best Practices docs (Story 3.2), feedback survey template, weekly check-in schedule
5. API cost support plan established: subsidize costs if needed (founder covers ~$50-100 for beta phase) or verify testers have institutional Claude access
6. Expectations set clearly: this is MVP with rough edges, focus is exploratory Meta-analysis not publication-grade, testers will encounter bugs and provide detailed reports
7. Communication channel established: Discord server, Slack workspace, or GitHub Discussions for async Q&A and community building
8. Beta testing goals communicated: validate 90% extraction accuracy, measure time savings, identify failure modes, gather testimonials
9. **Recruitment contingency plan defined: if fewer than 5 testers recruited by Week 4 of recruitment phase, pivot to extended solo testing with 20+ diverse papers across 5+ disciplines to maintain validation rigor** *(PO Validation: Must-Fix #5)*

## Story 3.5: Conduct Validation Studies with Beta Testers

As a solo founder seeking to validate MVP assumptions,
I want beta testers to complete systematic validation studies,
so that I can empirically verify extraction accuracy, time savings, and usability claims before broader release.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Validation protocol designed: each beta tester extracts data from 10-20 papers using Microscope, at least 3 papers per tester have expert manual extraction "gold standard" for comparison (pre-existing or tester provides their own)
2. Accuracy validation conducted: compare AI-extracted data against gold standard, calculate agreement percentage (target: 90%+ for 🟢 labeled data, document disagreement patterns)
3. Time savings measured: testers log extraction time per paper and compare against their typical manual workflow (target: 50% reduction)
4. Usability metrics collected: time-to-first-data-card for new users (target: <45 minutes), task completion rate (target: 80%+ complete 10+ papers), user confidence self-ratings
5. Three-color labeling effectiveness evaluated: percentage of uncertain/computed data successfully flagged 🟡/🔴, false positive/negative rates
6. Failure mode documentation: collect all errors, bugs, confusion points, prompt failures encountered by beta testers with categorization
7. Qualitative feedback gathered: structured interviews or surveys asking "What worked well? What frustrated you? Would you use this for real projects? What's missing?"
8. Results documented in validation report with aggregate statistics, anonymized user quotes, recommendations for improvement

## Story 3.6: Refine Prompts and Documentation Based on Beta Feedback

As a solo founder committed to iterative improvement,
I want to systematically address feedback from beta testing,
so that subsequent users have better experience and higher success rates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Feedback analysis conducted: categorize all beta tester issues by type (prompt bugs, documentation gaps, usability problems, missing features), prioritize by frequency and severity
2. Prompt refinements implemented: update Microscope, Compiler, Oracle templates to fix identified bugs and improve clarity (minimum 5 refinements based on feedback)
3. Documentation updates applied: revise Quick Start Guide and Best Practices to address confusion points, add FAQ section with beta tester questions
4. Edge case handling improved: add guidance for failure modes discovered during beta testing that weren't caught in solo testing
5. Version changelog maintained: document all changes made post-beta in CHANGELOG.md with rationale and references to beta feedback
6. Re-testing conducted: at least 2 beta testers invited to re-test refined prompts and confirm improvements
7. Regression prevention: ensure refinements don't break functionality that was working (test with Epic 1-2 sample papers)
8. Beta tester acknowledgments: credit contributors in README and documentation (with permission)

## Story 3.7: Document Success Stories and Prepare for Community Launch

As a solo founder preparing to launch MAestro to wider community,
I want to showcase validated success stories and establish credibility,
so that new users trust the tool and the research community takes it seriously.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Case studies documented: at least 2-3 beta tester projects written up as success stories (research question, papers analyzed, results obtained, user testimonial)
2. Methodology preprint drafted (optional but valuable): describe MAestro approach, three-element toolbox philosophy, three-color labeling system, validation study results—submit to Meta-research journal or arXiv
3. Community launch plan created: Reddit posts, academic Twitter announcement, relevant mailing list outreach, personal network sharing
4. GitHub repository polished: comprehensive README with badges (license, version), clear contribution guidelines, example projects showcased, documentation site live
5. Testimonials collected: at least 3 quotes from beta testers for README and launch materials (with permission and attribution)
6. Launch metrics defined: GitHub stars target (50+ in first month), documentation traffic (100+ unique visitors), community engagement (10+ questions/discussions)
7. Post-launch support plan: commit to responding to issues within 48 hours, weekly community Q&A sessions for first month, roadmap published for Phase 2 features
8. Academic credibility signals: list any Meta-analysis methodologists who reviewed/endorsed approach, reference validation study results, emphasize transparency standards (RAAA appendix)
