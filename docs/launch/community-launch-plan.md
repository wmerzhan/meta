# MAestro Community Launch Plan

**Launch Window:** 2025-11-03 → 2025-11-30  
**Owner:** Solo founder (MAestro)  
**Objective:** Convert beta validation momentum into public credibility and early adopter engagement while maintaining transparency commitments.

---

## 1. Messaging Pillars
1. **Evidence-Backed Automation** – Highlight 95.2% accuracy on gold standards, 52% average time savings, and three-color labeling safeguards.  
2. **Transparency by Design** – Emphasize RAAA appendix, prompt version pinning (Microscope/Compiler/Oracle v1.1.0), and local-first privacy posture.  
3. **Community Co-Creation** – Showcase beta tester testimonials, roadmap openness, and call for discipline-specific contributors.

## 2. Channel Strategy & Content Angles

| Channel | Audience | Content Angle | Assets & Links | Cadence |
|---------|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Reddit** (r/Scholar, r/AcademicPsychology, r/MetaAnalysis) | Researchers seeking tools | “Case studies prove MAestro cuts extraction time in half” | Case studies folder, README badges, metrics dashboard | Launch day + follow-up AMA thread (week 2) |
| **Academic Twitter/X** | Methodologists, meta-scientists | Thread on validation metrics + transparency commitments | Infographic (accuracy/time savings), methodology outline, RAAA appendix | Launch day thread + weekly highlights |
| **Meta-Research Mailing Lists** (SREE, Campbell, Cochrane) | Evidence synthesis community | Formal announcement linking preprint outline and documentation | Preprint outline PDF, documentation site, support plan | Launch week + month-end results email |
| **Personal Network Outreach** (email + LinkedIn) | Prior collaborators, lab networks | Personalized invite to try MAestro with support commitments | Case studies, onboarding resources, calendar booking link | Rolling over launch week |
| **GitHub Discussions** | Early adopters already in repo | Kick-off post summarizing launch assets, invite questions | Launch plan, metrics dashboard, support commitments | Launch day + weekly Q&A prompts |

## 4. Asset Checklist
- ✅ Case studies (docs/case-studies/*.md) linked from README/index.  
- ✅ Methodology preprint outline (docs/launch/methodology-preprint.md).  
- ☐ Launch metrics dashboard (docs/launch/metrics-dashboard.md).  
- ☐ Testimonials & credibility roll-up (docs/launch/testimonials.md).  
- ☐ Support plan (docs/launch/support-plan.md) + roadmap summary (docs/launch/roadmap.md or support-plan section).  
- ☐ README badges + documentation nav updates (Story 3.7 Task 4).

## 5. Escalation Thresholds & Response Plan
- **GitHub stars < 25 by Nov 15** → Double down on personal outreach; schedule live demo webinar for Nov 20.  
- **Docs traffic < 50 unique visitors by Nov 15** → Coordinate cross-post with meta-analysis methodologists; release behind-the-scenes video walkthrough.  
- **Community questions < 5 threads by Nov 15** → Seed discussion prompts (e.g., “Share your toughest extraction edge case”).  
- **Negative feedback on transparency (any) or accuracy (<80%)** → Trigger rapid response: publish clarification blog, open GitHub issue, address in README FAQ, notify testers.

## 6. Tracking & Governance
- Metrics recorded weekly (Mondays) in `docs/launch/metrics-dashboard.md`.  
- Create GitHub Project board column “Launch Activities” to track outreach actions.  
- Maintain change log entries for every public communication (README Change Log section to be added).  
- Archive all launch copy in `.ai/launch/` (future automation) for reproducibility.

## 7. Outreach Scripts (Drafts)
- **Reddit opener:** “We just wrapped a 7-tester validation sprint (95.2% accuracy) and published three success stories. Here’s how MAestro keeps AI-assisted extraction auditable.”  
- **Twitter thread hook:** “AI for meta-analysis? Here’s how we validated MAestro across 91 papers with 7 researchers—and why transparency was non-negotiable.”  
- **Mailing list subject:** “Evidence-based automation for meta-analysis: MAestro beta launch + methodology preprint outline.”

## 8. Owner Commitments
- Personally respond to launch-week inquiries within 24 hours (support plan extends to 48-hour SLA post-launch).  
- Publish weekly update note (GitHub Discussions) summarizing metrics, wins, and upcoming focus.  
- Document all outreach feedback in GitHub Discussions thread `Launch Feedback` for traceability with RAAA appendix references.
