## 3. Data Collection Workflow
1. Every Monday 09:00 local time, export GitHub Insights CSVs (stars, traffic, community).  
2. Pull MkDocs analytics from GitHub Pages (enable traffic logs) and append to `metrics-dashboard.md`.  
3. Update newsletter signups and interview count from CRM spreadsheet.  
4. Summarize key deltas in GitHub Discussions `Launch Updates` thread and reference this dashboard commit hash.

## 4. Escalation Triggers
- **Stars growth < 10 per week** → escalate to founder; schedule live demo webinar.  
- **Docs visitors < 25 per week** → run targeted outreach to methods mailing lists + share preview video.  
- **Support SLA breach (any issue >48h)** → add additional office hours and document root cause in support plan.  
- **Negative sentiment > 20% of Reddit/Twitter comments** → issue clarification blog and update FAQ.

## 5. Reporting Template (for weekly updates)
- **Week of:** YYYY-MM-DD  
- **Highlights:** 2–3 bullet wins.  
- **Challenges:** Metrics below threshold and mitigation actions.  
- **Community Pulse:** Notable feedback quotes (with source link).  
- **Next Actions:** Outreach or product updates planned.
