**Effective Date:** 2025-11-03  
**Owner:** Solo founder (MAestro)  
**Scope:** Controlled beta launch support, community communication, and Phase 2/3 roadmap commitments.

## 1. Support Commitments

| Channel | Purpose | Initial Response SLA | Resolution Target | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| GitHub Issues | Bug reports, feature requests | ≤ 24 hours (weekday) | ≤ 72 hours for triage; critical fixes hot-patched | Use new issue templates; label with `support` + severity |
| GitHub Discussions | Q&A, success sharing | ≤ 24 hours (weekday), ≤ 48 hours weekends | Continuous | Pin “Launch Updates” thread for weekly summaries |
| Email (support@maestro-meta.org) | Sensitive requests / private data | ≤ 24 hours | Case-by-case (document in internal CRM) | Route outcomes back to public tracker when possible |
| Live Office Hours (Zoom) | Real-time triage | Weekly 60-minute session | N/A | Schedule published below |

**Escalation Flow:**  
1. Log issue in GitHub with label `needs-triage`.  
2. If blocking (accuracy <80%, data loss), escalate to “Critical” label and announce in Discussions.  
3. Document resolution steps in `docs/launch/support-plan.md#incident-log` (append per incident).  
4. Update README/FAQ when recurring issues identified.

## 2. Response-Time Guidelines
- Triage all new GitHub issues within **24 hours**; acknowledge weekends within **48 hours**.  
- Provide status update every **48 hours** on open issues until resolved.  
- Critical launch blockers: publish mitigation note in Discussions and README within **12 hours**.  
- Track SLA compliance in metrics dashboard (Issue SLA metric).

## 3. Community Engagement Schedule
