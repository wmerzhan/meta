## 1. Beta Tester Testimonials

| Quote | Source | Discipline / Role | Context | Consent |
|-------|--------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| “MAestro saved me hours every week. Even with fact-checking the green labels, it’s probably 50-60% faster than doing it all manually.” | Tester-02 | Public Health / Epidemiology (Assistant Professor) | Cardiovascular risk factor validation (14 papers, 3 gold standards) | ✅ Logged 2025-10-24 |
| “I’m not a statistics person, so there was a learning curve… but once I got it, MAestro definitely saved time compared to copying numbers into Excel.” | Tester-03 | Education Research (Postdoc) | K-12 literacy interventions (12 papers, first-time meta-analyst) | ✅ Logged 2025-10-24 |
| “The green/yellow/red labels were game-changers. I trusted green data about 90% of the time, spot-checked it for critical fields… Clear guidance.” | Tester-05 | Social Psychology (Associate Professor) | Prejudice reduction interventions (15 papers, expert validator) | ✅ Logged 2025-10-24 |
| “Surprisingly good for environmental science. I’d use it for exploratory reviews right away.” | Tester-07 | Environmental Policy (PhD student) | Climate intervention synthesis (12 papers + 1 follow-up) | ✅ Logged 2025-10-24 |

### Deployment Guidance
- Feature at least three quotes in README, launch materials, and documentation homepage.  
- Attribute by discipline + role (names anonymized per IRB protocol).  
- Link each quote to its corresponding success story for deeper narrative.

## 2. Academic Credibility Signals

| Endorser | Affiliation / Expertise | Validation Scope | Key Takeaway |
|----------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Medical/Epidemiology Expert | University hospital epidemiologist (8 years meta-analysis) | Diagnostic accuracy studies (`nakashima_2003`, `chen_2021_cluster`) | “Accuracy improved from 82% → 94%; PDF quality assessment saved 25+ minutes. Ready for production.” |
| Behavioral Science Expert | Psychology intervention specialist (6 years meta-analysis) | Multi-arm trials (`smith_2020_multiarm`, `garcia_2019_multiarm`) | “Multi-arm handling is excellent; all comparisons clear. Ready for education researchers.” |
| QA Gate (Quinn) | Test Architect & Quality Advisor | Story 3.6 QA review | 95/100 quality score; GO decision for controlled beta launch. |

### Usage Notes
- Reference domain expert endorsements in launch communications and methodology preprint.  
- Include QA gate score and GO decision in investor or stakeholder updates.  
- Maintain traceability by linking to `tests/validation/3.6_retesting_completion_report.md`.

## 3. Transparency & Ethics Commitments

- **RAAA Alignment:** All public materials point to `docs/raaa-usage.md` and Story 3.3 appendix template to document AI involvement, prompt versions, and conversation log handling.  
- **Prompt Version Pinning:** Communication assets must cite Microscope/Compiler/Oracle v1.1.0 and link to CHANGELOG entries.  
- **Consent Handling:** Keep consent notes in the beta roster; update `docs/launch/testimonials.md` if attribution changes.  
- **Data Authenticity:** No real research data published; all success stories use synthetic validation assets documented in Story 3.5.

## 4. Integration Checklist

- [ ] README Success Stories section updated (Story 3.7 Task 4).  
- [ ] Launch announcements reference at least two testimonials.  
- [ ] `docs/index.md` highlights success stories with quote snippets.  
- [ ] Metrics dashboard tracks testimonial usage outcomes (engagement vs. without quotes).

## 5. Future Additions
- Capture real-user testimonials post-controlled beta (target: 3 new quotes by 2025-12-15).  
- Record video testimonials for long-form launch content.  
- Maintain academic endorsements (e.g., methodologist peer reviewers) with DOI references once preprint is published.  
- Add translation-ready quotes for non-English outreach once new testers join.
