  traceability: |
    AC1: Recruitment outreach (4 channels: personal network, Twitter, Reddit, mailing lists)
    AC2: Diversity targeting (3+ disciplines, mixed career stages, mixed technical levels)
    AC3: Selection criteria (7-question questionnaire with scoring system)
    AC4: Onboarding package (Quick Start, Best Practices, surveys, check-in schedule)
    AC5: Cost support plan (2-path system: institutional access + founder subsidy)
    AC6: Clear expectations (7 known limitations, MVP status, time commitment)
    AC7: Communication infrastructure (GitHub Discussions + optional Discord)
    AC8: Beta goals communicated (90% accuracy, 50% time savings, 10-20 failure modes, testimonials)
    AC9: Contingency plan (Week 4 decision point, pivot to extended solo testing if <5 testers)

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Data privacy addressed; NDA option available; communication channels have appropriate privacy settings'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async-first design ensures inclusivity; weekly check-ins (5-10 min) respect tester time; end-of-beta survey (20 min) reasonable'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Built-in contingency plan for recruitment shortfall; weekly monitoring; mid-point assessment at Week 3; multiple support channels'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All documentation self-contained and professionally structured; clear templates and checklists; dependencies (Stories 3.1/3.2) validated'

risk_profile:
  technical_risk: LOW
  execution_risk: MEDIUM
  execution_risk_details: |
    Primary: Recruitment shortfall (may not reach 5 testers) - Medium-High probability
      Mitigation: Excellent contingency plan with Week 4 decision point + extended solo testing
    Secondary: Tester engagement quality (low-quality feedback) - Low probability
      Mitigation: Strong selection criteria (AC3) filter for feedback quality; weekly monitoring
    Tertiary: Founder availability (Weeks 1-5) - Medium probability
      Mitigation: Async communication options; contingency plan works without intensive founder involvement
    Quaternary: Cost overrun - Very Low probability
      Mitigation: Detailed cost modeling, API key spending limits, daily alerts built into plan
  dependency_risk: LOW
    Notes: Quick Start Guide (Story 3.1) user-tested (40-41 min vs 45-min target, 5/5 clarity); Best Practices (Story 3.2) expert-reviewed (88/100)

readiness:
  executable: true
  completeness: COMPLETE
  documentation_coverage: COMPREHENSIVE
  contingency_planning: EXCELLENT
  timeline_feasibility: REALISTIC
  next_action: 'Proceed with Week 1 recruitment launch. Pre-launch verification of Stories 3.1/3.2 deployment is only pre-execution recommendation.'

summary:
  strengths: |
    1. Comprehensive: 9 production-ready documents (52,600 words) covering all execution aspects
    2. Transparent: MVP status, 7 known limitations, realistic expectations, honest about contingencies
    3. Risk-Aware: Well-detailed contingency plan for recruitment failure; weekly monitoring built-in
    4. Cost-Conscious: Transparent cost breakdown with 2-path support system ($50-100 total budget)
    5. Inclusive: Accessibility for varying technical comfort; async-friendly; multiple support channels
    6. Well-Planned: Week-by-week execution checklists with specific actions and success criteria
  concerns: |
    1. Pre-launch: Verify Stories 3.1 & 3.2 deliverables are genuinely production-ready
    2. Availability: Confirm founder has bandwidth for recruitment period (Weeks 1-5)
    3. Recruitment: Medium-High probability of not reaching 5-tester minimum (mitigated by contingency)
  approval: 'This story demonstrates mature process planning. All 9 ACs satisfied with clear validation paths. Recommend immediate execution.'
