notes: |
  BLOCKING CONDITION: Story status is "In Progress" (required: "Review") and Task 5 is incomplete.

  POSITIVE ASSESSMENT: The completed work (Tasks 1-4) demonstrates exceptional quality:
  - Directory structure perfectly matches architectural requirements
  - Documentation is comprehensive, professional, and well-organized
  - All required cross-platform setup instructions included
  - MkDocs configuration is professional with Material theme
  - Best practices followed (.gitkeep files, organized .gitignore)

  The CONCERNS gate reflects incomplete status rather than quality issues. Once Task 5 is
  completed and placeholders are replaced, this story should easily achieve PASS status.

  Quality score calculation: 100 - 10 (incomplete Task 5) - 10 (placeholder URLs) - 5 (incomplete Dev Agent Record) = 75
