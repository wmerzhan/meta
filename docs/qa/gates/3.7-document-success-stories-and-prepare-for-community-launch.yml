  ## Gate Decision: PASS ✅

  ### Summary
  Story 3.7 successfully delivers comprehensive community launch collateral with all eight acceptance criteria met. The two blocking concerns from the initial review have been resolved:
  1. README has been updated with direct documentation site links (no "coming soon" language)
  2. CI/CD automation implemented for continuous build verification (deploy-docs.yml)

  ### Evidence by Acceptance Criterion
  - **AC1:** Three case studies (cardiovascular, literacy, climate) with quantitative metrics and testimonials under docs/case-studies/
  - **AC2:** Methodology preprint outline covering architecture, validation methodology, RAAA transparency
  - **AC3:** Community launch plan with messaging pillars, multi-channel strategy (Reddit, Twitter, mailing lists, GitHub), and Nov 3 timeline
  - **AC4 ✅ RESOLVED:** README now displays live documentation links (README.md:63, 68); mkdocs.yml properly configured; CI/CD workflow setup for automated builds and GitHub Pages deployment
  - **AC5:** Testimonials collected from beta testers with attribution and consent metadata
  - **AC6:** Metrics dashboard defines targets (50+ stars, 100+ visitors, 10+ discussions) with escalation thresholds
  - **AC7:** Support plan commits to 24/48hr SLA, weekly Q&A sessions, and Phase 2 roadmap visibility
  - **AC8:** Academic credibility signals documented with validation results, transparency commitments, and expert endorsements

  ### Key Improvements from Initial Review
  - README links to https://maestro-meta.github.io without "coming soon" language
  - mkdocs.yml navigation structure includes all launch materials (community-launch-plan, metrics-dashboard, methodology-preprint, testimonials, support-plan)
  - Automated CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml) ensures mkdocs build --strict runs on every push to main/master
  - All referenced files exist and cross-link correctly across case-studies, launch resources, and templates

  ### Launch Readiness Assessment
  Story 3.7 is **ready for community launch**. Recommend final review of timeline dates (Oct 28 milestones are past review date; confirm Nov 3 public launch target is still accurate) and asset checklist status before public announcement.

  ### Risk Posture
  **Low Risk.** No critical or high-severity issues. Documentation-only changes with no security/privacy impact. Local-first positioning maintained. Two advisory items for post-launch monitoring: (1) weekly metrics tracking through Nov 30, (2) response-time SLA compliance verification.
