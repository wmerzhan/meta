gate: PASS
status_reason: '7 of 8 acceptance criteria fully satisfied. AC#6 (20-card context window test) partially complete due to data constraints (only 7 cards available). Prompt template is comprehensive, well-documented, and production-ready for current datasets. Batch processing documented for larger compilations. Recommend completing AC#6 when additional data cards become available.'

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Prompt is documentation-only instruction set; no executable code. Error handling includes safe file parsing. No security vulnerabilities identified.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Context window management documented (lines 298-321). Batch processing recommendations for >50 cards. Theoretical support for 10-100 cards; practical validation pending.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling for 10+ failure modes (missing fields, malformed tables, duplicate IDs, invalid values). Quality summary provides actionability for meta-analysts.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Semantic versioning (v1.0), detailed CHANGELOG, clear dependencies on Story 2.1 schema and Story 1.6 data cards. Prompt structure follows MAestro architecture standards.'
