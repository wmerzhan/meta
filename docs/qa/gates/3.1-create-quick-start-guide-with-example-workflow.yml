# QA Review Summary

## Strengths

âœ… **Exceptional Planning:** 13-task breakdown with clear inputs/outputs covering all 8 ACs
âœ… **AC Coverage:** 7 of 8 ACs fully implemented (AC7 appropriately pending)
âœ… **Documentation Quality:** Real case study (14 papers, 861 patients), 30+ code examples, 23 terminal outputs, 10 failure modes documented
âœ… **Testing Strategy:** Well-designed UAT protocol with 2 naive users, 12-item validation checklist, measurable success criteria
âœ… **Standards Compliance:** Explicit adherence to Rules 6-7, project structure, and MVP testing approach
âœ… **NFR Alignment:** Performance claims (45-min target) appropriately validated via user testing gate

## Blockers

ðŸŸ¡ **AC7 User Testing (Task 12):** Not yet executedâ€”this is the final validation gate for NFR4
   - Expected outcome: PASS if both users complete in <45 min with no blocking errors
   - Protocol well-documented; proceed with confidence

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Execute Task 12 (user testing) using provided protocol
2. **THEN:** Execute Task 13 (final verification and publication)
3. **GATE:** Re-evaluate after Task 12 - likely to become PASS if testing succeeds

## Recommended Status

**Path Forward:**
- Current: **Ready for User Testing** âœ“
- After Task 12 success: **Ready for Done** âœ“
- After Task 13 completion: **Published** ðŸ“–
