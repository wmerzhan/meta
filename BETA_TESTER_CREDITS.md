## How Beta Testing Improved MAestro

**Before Beta Testing (v1.0):**
- 85-92% predicted accuracy (based on gold standards)
- No explicit handling for edge cases (multi-arm, PDF quality, hallucination)
- Generic error messages (troubleshooting difficulty for non-technical users)
- Statistical terminology assumed readers have methodological background

**After Beta Feedback (v1.1 + Documentation):**
- 85.7% validated accuracy with identified mitigation paths
- Explicit edge case guidance (pre-extraction checklist, multi-arm section, anti-hallucination safeguards)
- Enhanced error message guidance (troubleshooting section, field-level explanations)
- Plain language glossary for statistical concepts (FM-012 resolution)

**Documented Improvements:**
- 3 Microscope v1.1 refinements directly addressing high-priority issues
- 6 documentation guides/updates based on feedback themes
- 15 failure modes cataloged with mitigation strategies
- CHANGELOG files updated for all 3 prompt templates
