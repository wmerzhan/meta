# Communication Infrastructure Setup Guide

## Overview

This document provides setup instructions for beta tester communication channels. The recommended approach is **GitHub Discussions (primary) + optional Discord (backup)** for real-time support.

---

## Part 1: GitHub Discussions Setup (Primary Channel)

### Why GitHub Discussions?

✅ **Advantages:**
- Lives in the repository (integrated with code/docs)
- Permanent searchable archive (great for documentation)
- Free tier is unlimited
- Integrates with existing dev workflows
- No additional platform to manage
- Accessible to all GitHub users

⚠️ **Limitations:**
- Less real-time than Discord (async-focused)
- Steeper learning curve for non-technical testers
- Requires GitHub account

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Discussions

**If not already enabled in your repo:**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Settings → Features → Check "Discussions"
3. Click "Set up discussions"
4. Choose a discussion category layout (see below)

### Step 2: Create Discussion Categories

**Set up these 5 categories:**

#### Category 1: Getting Started 🚀

**Description:** "Welcome to beta testing! Start here for setup help, account creation, and first-paper questions."

**Guidelines:**
- How do I create a Claude account?
- Help with Quick Start installation
- First-paper troubleshooting
- "Where do I find...?" type questions

**Pinned post:** "Welcome to MAestro Beta Testing" (see template below)

---

#### Category 2: Questions & Support 🤔

**Description:** "Ask questions about how to use MAestro, interpret results, and best practices."

**Guidelines:**
- "How do I extract [specific type of data]?"
- "What does this output mean?"
- "How do I optimize my workflow?"
- "Which component should I use for...?"

---

#### Category 3: Bug Reports 🐛

**Description:** "Report bugs, errors, and unexpected behavior. Use the template provided."

**Guidelines:**
- Unexpected crashes or errors
- Data extraction not working correctly
- Installation issues
- Performance problems

**Pinned post:** Bug reporting template (see below)

---

#### Category 4: Feature Requests & Ideas 💡

**Description:** "Suggest features you'd like to see. Vote on ideas from other testers."

**Guidelines:**
- Features that would help your workflow
- Improvement suggestions
- New analysis types you'd like
- Wishlist items

---

#### Category 5: Wins & Celebrations 🎉

**Description:** "Share your successes! Celebrate completed papers, interesting findings, and wins."

**Guidelines:**
- "I successfully extracted 20 papers!"
- "Saved 2 hours on my literature review"
- "Found a great use case for..."
- Testimonials and success stories

---

### Step 3: Create Pinned Welcome Post

**Post to "Getting Started" category:**

```

### Step 6: Create Code of Conduct / Communication Norms

**Post to "Getting Started" category as discussion:**

```markdown
# Community Guidelines & Communication Norms

We're building a community of researchers who care about methodological rigor.
Here's how we work together:

## Be Respectful
- Different disciplines, different perspectives
- Feedback is a gift; receive it generously
- We disagree respectfully

## Be Specific
- "This doesn't work" → Not helpful
- "I extracted 15 papers successfully. On paper X, table extraction failed on merged cells. Screenshot attached." → VERY helpful
- Specific examples help us improve faster

## Share Knowledge
- Know the answer to someone's question? Help out!
- Share tips and workarounds in the channel
- We're building collective knowledge

## Protect Research Data
- Don't paste actual research data/papers in public channels
- Use private messages or email for sensitive content
- Confidentiality is important

## Have Fun
- Celebrate wins (no matter how small!)
- Help each other debug
- Enjoy the process

## Report Issues
- **Bugs:** Use bug report template in #bug-reports
- **Bad behavior:** DM @[Founder] directly
- **Urgent:** Post in Discord or email directly

---

Thanks for being part of this! 🙌
```

### Step 7: Weekly Check-In Post Template

**Schedule:** Post every Friday morning

```markdown

- Need to manage invites, permissions

### Setup (If Desired)

**Step 1: Create Discord Server**
1. Go to Discord.com
2. "Create a Server"
3. Name: "MAestro Beta Testing"
4. Server icon: MAestro logo (if you have one)

**Step 2: Create Channels**

```

## Part 7: Monitoring & Health Metrics

### Engagement Metrics

**Track weekly:**
- Number of new discussions/messages
- Response time to questions (target: <24 hours)
- Number of bugs reported
- Feature request frequency
- Sentiment in #wins vs. #bugs

### Health Checks

**Week 1:** Are testers finding channels? Getting help? Quick response time?

**Week 3:** Are engagement levels sustaining? Anyone quiet?

**Week 5:** Are we seeing valuable feedback? Bugs tracked? Features catalogued?

---

## Part 8: Post-Beta Archive

### Export Process

1. **GitHub Discussions:**
   - Settings → Export discussions as markdown
   - Save to `tests/validation/beta_testing_feedback_archive.md`

2. **Discord:**
   - Use Discord bot (like Archiver) or manual export
   - Convert to readable format
   - Save to same location

3. **Organize:**
   - By category (bugs, features, wins, etc.)
   - By discipline (insights by research field)
   - By time period (weekly summaries)

### Documentation

Create "Beta Testing Results Summary" that includes:
- Total testers, papers extracted, bugs found
- Top 10 feature requests
