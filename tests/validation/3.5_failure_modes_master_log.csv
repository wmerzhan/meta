FM-001,2025-10-30,Tester-04,Prompt Bug,Critical,Hallucinated effect size on large PDFs,Microscope reported incorrect effect size value (d=0.42 vs actual d=0.32) on Paper-049 which was >20 pages with poor OCR quality,Extract paper >20 pages with poor PDF quality and complex tables,Recurring (2 testers),Yes,Open,3 × 2 = 6,Also reported by Tester-01 on Paper-010 - appears related to large context + poor OCR
FM-002,2025-11-01,Tester-03,Usability,Major,Unclear error message for validation failures,Error message "Validation failed" without context on which field or what to fix,Run extraction on paper with incomplete metadata,Recurring (3 testers),Yes,Open,2 × 3 = 6,Testers want specific field identification and suggested fix
FM-003,2025-11-02,Tester-02,Edge Case,Major,PDF quality threshold handling unclear,Scanned PDFs with <60% OCR confidence fail silently or produce yellow/red labels without clear explanation,Use any poor-quality scanned PDF from 1990s or earlier,Widespread (4 testers),Yes,Open,2 × 3 = 6,"Testers want upfront warning: ""PDF quality may affect accuracy"""
FM-004,2025-10-29,Tester-03,User Confusion,Minor,Three-color labeling interpretation unclear initially,Tester initially unsure if yellow means "needs review" or "likely wrong" or "computed value",Read best practices guide and extract first few papers,First time,Yes,Closed,1 × 1 = 1,Resolved via guidance - added FAQ to documentation
FM-005,2025-11-05,Tester-06,Prompt Bug,Major,Diagnostic accuracy metrics misread,Sensitivity value extracted as 0.85 when paper states 0.82 on Paper-076,Extract diagnostic accuracy study with sensitivity/specificity reporting,First time,Yes,Open,2 × 1 = 2,Specialized metrics may need prompt refinement
FM-006,2025-11-03,Tester-02,Edge Case,Major,Multi-site trial heterogeneous reporting,Multi-site trials with site-specific results difficult to extract - MAestro unsure which effect size to prioritize,Extract multi-site RCT with heterogeneous site-level reporting (Paper-022),Recurring (2 testers),Yes,Open,2 × 2 = 4,Needs guidance on "aggregate vs. site-specific extraction"
FM-007,2025-11-08,Tester-04,Edge Case,Major,Neuroimaging outcome metrics unfamiliar,fMRI metrics and brain activation data not well-extracted - labeled yellow/red appropriately but tester expected green,Extract neuroimaging RCT with brain activation outcomes (Paper-042),First time,Yes,Open,2 × 1 = 2,Domain-specific metrics - may need specialized training data
FM-008,2025-11-10,Tester-07,Usability,Minor,OCR failure on graphs/figures,Figures and graphs in PDFs not extractable - MAestro skips them without clear indication,Extract paper with key data in figure format (Paper-087),Recurring (2 testers),Yes,Open,1 × 2 = 2,Expected limitation but testers want notification
FM-009,2025-11-06,Tester-01,Prompt Bug,Major,Multi-arm trial effect size selection unclear,Paper-004 had 3 treatment arms - MAestro extracted only one effect size without indicating which comparison,Extract multi-arm RCT with 3+ arms,Recurring (3 testers),Yes,Open,2 × 3 = 6,Needs logic: extract all pairwise comparisons or flag for manual selection
FM-010,2025-11-12,Tester-05,Edge Case,Minor,Mediation analysis data extraction,Paper-058 reported mediation effects - MAestro labeled yellow appropriately but couldn't extract indirect effects,Extract paper with mediation or moderation analysis,First time,Yes,Open,1 × 1 = 1,Advanced statistical models - known limitation
FM-011,2025-10-31,Tester-06,User Confusion,Minor,Effect size type confusion (OR vs RR vs HR),Tester initially confused about when MAestro uses OR vs RR vs HR - documentation clarified,Review extracted data and check effect size types,First time,Yes,Closed,1 × 1 = 1,Resolved via documentation - added glossary
FM-012,2025-11-15,Tester-03,Usability,Major,Statistical terminology accessibility,Non-technical users struggle with statistical jargon in MAestro output (e.g. "standardized mean difference" vs "Cohen's d"),Extract papers and review output as non-statistician,Widespread (2 testers - both low technical comfort),Yes,Open,2 × 2 = 4,Plain language option requested for non-technical users
FM-013,2025-11-09,Tester-07,Edge Case,Minor,Environmental/policy metrics unfamiliar,Carbon footprint and policy outcomes initially flagged yellow - MAestro unfamiliar with domain-specific metrics (Paper-080),Extract environmental science RCT with climate/policy outcomes,First time,Yes,Open,1 × 1 = 1,Domain-specific - acceptable limitation
FM-014,2025-11-18,Tester-05,Prompt Bug,Minor,Cluster RCT design classification,Some cluster RCTs labeled as "RCT cluster" (correct) while others labeled "RCT 2-arm" (missing cluster detail),Extract cluster-randomized trial,Recurring (2 testers),Yes,Open,1 × 2 = 2,Inconsistent detection of cluster randomization
FM-015,2025-11-20,Tester-02,Usability,Minor,Missing confidence interval computation,Paper-018 reported SE but not CI - MAestro flagged yellow but didn't auto-compute CI from SE,Extract paper reporting SE or SD without explicit CI,First time,Yes,Open,1 × 1 = 1,Feature request: auto-compute CI from SE when possible
