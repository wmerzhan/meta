## Test 2: Context Window Scalability (20-Card Test)

### Test Status

**Status:** NOT CONDUCTED - Insufficient data cards

**Reason:** Only 7 data cards available in repository; Story 2.2 AC#6 requires testing with 20+ cards to confirm Claude Code context window viability.

### Recommended Future Test Protocol

When 20+ data cards are available:

**Test Setup:**
1. Collect or generate 20 diverse data cards (mix of RCTs, cohort studies, quasi-experimental)
2. Include variety of:
   - Effect size types (continuous, dichotomous, correlation)
   - Study quality levels (high, medium, low)
   - Data completeness (complete, partial, missing fields)
   - Label distributions (high 🟢, mixed, high 🔴)

**Execution:**
```
Input directory: tests/validation/twenty_card_test/
Output file: tests/validation/compiler_test_output_20cards.csv
Prompt: prompts/compiler/compiler_v1.0.md
```

**Monitoring:**
- Track total context usage (tokens consumed)
- Measure processing time
- Verify output completeness (all 20 studies compiled)
- Check for context window warnings or truncation

**Expected Context Usage:**
- ~2-5KB per data card × 20 = 40-100KB total
- Plus prompt template (~15KB) + schema (~5KB)
- **Total Estimated:** 60-120KB (well within Claude Code context limits)

**Success Criteria:**
- All 20 data cards successfully compiled
- No context window overflow errors
- Output CSV contains 20+ rows (potentially more if multi-outcome studies)
- Data quality summary generated correctly
- Error log documents any issues encountered
- Processing completes within reasonable time (<5 minutes)

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Context window exceeded → Requires batch processing workflow
- Incomplete compilation → Missing data cards or parsing errors
- Performance degradation → Consider optimizations (streaming, incremental writes)

### Context Window Notes

**Theoretical Limit:**
- Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 context: ~200K tokens
- Compiler prompt template: ~15K tokens
- Schema reference: ~5K tokens
- Per data card: 2-5K tokens (varies by extraction detail)

**Practical Estimates:**
- **10 cards:** ~20-50K tokens (comfortable)
- **20 cards:** ~40-100K tokens (optimal batch size)
- **50 cards:** ~100-250K tokens (may approach limits; recommend batching)
- **100 cards:** 200-500K tokens (requires batch processing)

**Recommendation:**
- Validate 20-card compilation as primary workflow
- For >50 cards, document batch processing workflow (compile 20-30 at a time, merge outputs)
- Update compiler prompt with batch mode instructions if needed

**Data Card:**
```markdown
| Variable | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Sample size | 54 | 🟢 (p. 163, Methods section, line 1: "The subjects of this study were 54 consecutive patients") |
```

**Expected CSV Row:**

|---------|-------------|-----|------------------------|
| Recurrence | 1.73 | ... | 🟡 Calculated as RR = (21/31) / (9/23) = 1.73 from Table V, p.167 |
```

**Expected CSV Row:**
```csv
...,effect_size,source_color_label,...
...,0.548805,🟡,...
(Note: 0.548805 = ln(1.73), log-transformed per schema)
```

**Result:** PASS ✅

#### Case 3: Missing/Uncertain Data (🔴)

**Data Card:**
```markdown

## Test 6: Error Handling Validation

### Test Execution

**Objective:** Verify compiler handles malformed or incomplete data cards gracefully

### Test Scenarios (Simulated)

#### Scenario A: Missing YAML Field

**Data Card Issue:** `study_id` field missing from YAML frontmatter

**Expected Behavior:**
- Compiler flags error: "Data card [filename]: Missing required field study_id"
- Row skipped or assigned placeholder "UNKNOWN" with warning
- Error logged in compilation error log

**Test Result:** Expected behavior documented in prompt ✅

#### Scenario B: Malformed Markdown Table

**Data Card Issue:** Table has inconsistent column counts (3 columns in header, 4 in data row)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Compiler attempts best-effort parsing
- If parsing fails, skips table and logs: "Data card [filename]: Malformed table in section [section_name]"
- Continues with remaining tables

**Test Result:** Expected behavior documented in prompt ✅

#### Scenario C: Missing Source Label

**Data Card Issue:** Effect size row missing 🟢/🟡/🔴 emoji in "Source Label & Evidence" column

**Expected Behavior:**
- Compiler assigns 🔴 (red) by default
- Adds note: "Label missing from source data card"
- Logs warning in error log

**Test Result:** Expected behavior documented in prompt ✅

#### Scenario D: Duplicate study_id

**Data Card Issue:** Two data cards have identical `study_id` values

**Expected Behavior:**
- Compiler detects duplicate
- Appends suffix to second instance (e.g., `_v2`)
- Logs: "Duplicate study_id detected: [study_id]; renamed to [study_id_v2]"

**Test Result:** Expected behavior documented in prompt ✅

#### Scenario E: Invalid Effect Size

**Data Card Issue:** Effect size field contains non-numeric text (e.g., "Not reported")

**Expected Behavior:**
- Compiler leaves field blank (empty)
- Logs: "Data card [filename]: Invalid effect size '[value]' in [outcome]"
- Row still created with other valid data

**Test Result:** Expected behavior documented in prompt ✅
