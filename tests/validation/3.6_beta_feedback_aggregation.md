## Part 1: Issue-by-Issue Breakdown

### HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES (Score ≥6 - Must Fix Before Public Launch)

#### **FM-001: Hallucinated Effect Size on Large/Poor PDFs**
- **Category:** Prompt Bug (Critical)
- **Severity:** Critical (3) × Frequency Widespread (2) = **Score 6**
- **Occurrence:** 2/21 gold standard papers (9.5%)
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-01, Tester-04

**Problem Description:**
Microscope v1.0 reports effect size values not present in the source paper, particularly on papers >20 pages or with poor OCR quality.

**Examples from Beta Testing:**
1. Paper shows OR = 1.25; Microscope reports OR = 1.45
2. Paper-049 (20+ pages, poor quality): Cohen's d reported as 0.42 vs. actual 0.32
3. Paper-010 (large PDF): Hallucination on effect size calculation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Context window limitations on lengthy documents
- LLM "fills in" plausible-looking values when OCR quality poor
- Insufficient hallucination detection in prompt

**Tester Quotes:**
> "I spotted a couple of hallucinated numbers on the really long papers. Made me super cautious about trusting the output." — **Tester-02**

> "The 20+ page paper gave me a bogus effect size. That's the kind of error that would torpedo a meta-analysis if I didn't catch it." — **Tester-01**

**Impact on Use Cases:**
- ❌ Blocks: Publication-grade meta-analyses without senior expert review
- ⚠️ Risky: Papers >15 pages (higher hallucination risk)
- ✅ OK: Papers <15 pages with good OCR

**Story 3.6 Refinement Needed:**
- Implement context truncation strategy for long papers
- Add explicit anti-hallucination directive in Microscope prompt
- Create validation rules to flag suspiciously "perfect" values
- Test with 5-10 large/poor-quality papers

---

#### **FM-003: PDF Quality Threshold Handling**
- **Category:** Edge Case (Major)
- **Severity:** Major (2) × Frequency Widespread (3) = **Score 6**
- **Occurrence:** 5/91 papers (5.5%) had quality issues; 4 testers reported
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-02, Tester-04, Tester-06, Tester-07

**Problem Description:**
System fails silently or produces poor output on scanned/low-quality PDFs without upfront warning, causing testers to waste time on un-extractable papers.

**Examples from Beta Testing:**
- Tester-04: "Old scanned papers from 1990s. MAestro would flag everything yellow/red because OCR couldn't read tables properly."
- Tester-02: "I'd spend 20 minutes extracting, only to get mostly yellow/red labels and realize the paper wasn't readable for the AI."
- Tester-06: "Some older oncology papers were scanned PDFs with terrible image quality. I would have appreciated an upfront 'PDF quality too low' warning."

**Root Cause:**
- No pre-extraction PDF quality assessment
- Users only discover quality issues after starting extraction
- No clear guidance on which PDFs will fail

**Tester Impact:**
> "I lost maybe 2 hours total on papers that just weren't readable. A simple quality check upfront would have saved me significant time." — **Tester-07**

**Requested Solution:**
- Display PDF quality score before extraction begins
- Clear warning: "This PDF may be too low quality for accurate extraction"
- Guidance: "Papers from 1980s-1990s or heavily scanned often have OCR issues"

**Story 3.6 Refinement Needed:**
- Implement PDF pre-screening with OCR confidence score
- Surface quality score to user before extraction
- Add PDF quality guidance to documentation
- Test PDF detection on 20+ papers (mix of quality levels)

---

#### **FM-009: Multi-Arm Trial Effect Size Selection**
- **Category:** Prompt Bug (Critical)
- **Severity:** Critical (3) × Frequency Recurring (2) = **Score 6**
- **Occurrence:** Affects ~15% of papers with multi-arm designs
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-01, Tester-04, Tester-05

**Problem Description:**
When paper reports multiple effect sizes (e.g., arm A vs. control, arm B vs. control, arm A vs. arm B), Microscope doesn't clearly handle or indicate which comparison was extracted as "primary."

**Examples from Beta Testing:**
1. **Paper-004:** 3 treatment arms + control. Microscope extracts effect sizes but doesn't indicate which is primary.
2. **Tester-01:** "MAestro gave me all the effect sizes but didn't tell me which comparison was the main study question. I had to go back to the paper to figure it out."
3. **Tester-05:** "Cluster RCTs sometimes labeled correctly, other times treated as standard 2-arm RCTs. I had to check every multi-arm design."

**Root Cause:**
- Prompt lacks explicit multi-arm handling logic
- No prioritization rule for "primary" vs. secondary comparisons
- Inconsistent cluster RCT detection

**Tester Impact:**
> "I spent extra time figuring out which effect size was actually the main finding. Clear labeling would have saved me 5+ minutes per multi-arm trial." — **Tester-04**

**Frequency in Sample:**
- Multi-arm trials in dataset: ~13 papers (14%)
- Papers where Microscope unclear: 3 papers
- Issue rate: 23% of multi-arm trials

**Story 3.6 Refinement Needed:**
- Add explicit multi-arm trial handling in Microscope prompt
- Clarify "primary" effect size selection logic (e.g., arm vs. control first, then arm-to-arm)
- Flag all pairwise comparisons clearly in output
- Label which comparison is "primary" vs. "secondary"
- Test with 5 multi-arm papers

---

#### **FM-002: Unclear Error Messages**
- **Category:** Usability (Major)
- **Severity:** Major (2) × Frequency Recurring (2) = **Score 4** (Borderline High)
- **Occurrence:** 4+ testers, 6+ instances
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-03, Tester-06, Tester-07, and others

**Problem Description:**
Error messages lack specificity about which field failed and how to fix it. Generic messages like "Validation failed" don't help users troubleshoot.

**Examples from Beta Testing:**
- Tester-03: "When something went wrong, error messages were cryptic. I'd see 'Validation failed' but have no idea which field was the problem."
- Tester-02: "Error messages need to be specific: instead of 'Validation failed,' say 'Sample size field missing - please check Table 1 or Methods section.'"
- Tester-06: "As someone without coding experience, I felt lost when errors happened. Better error explanations would help non-technical users."

**Current Error Messages (from logs):**
- "Validation failed" (no context)
- "Invalid format" (which field?)
- "Context error" (what to do?)
- "Metadata missing" (which metadata?)

**Impact on Non-Technical Users:**
- 1 tester (Tester-06) had negative experience partly due to unclear errors
- 2+ testers spent 15+ minutes troubleshooting unclear errors
- **Low-technical-comfort tester (Tester-06) satisfaction: 2/5**

**Story 3.6 Refinement Needed:**
- Add field-level error identification ("Sample size field failed")
- Include remediation guidance ("Check Table 1, page 3")
- Provide examples of correct format
- Test with non-technical users for clarity

---

### MEDIUM-PRIORITY ISSUES (Score 2-4 - Address in Story 3.6)

#### **FM-006: Multi-Site Trial Heterogeneous Reporting**
- **Category:** Edge Case (Major)
- **Score:** 2 × 2 = 4
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-02, Tester-05

**Issue:** Multi-site trials report both aggregate and site-specific effect sizes. Unclear which to extract or whether to include all.

**Example:** Paper-022 is multi-site RCT with site-level heterogeneity.

**Requested Guidance:**
- Document when to extract aggregate vs. site-specific
- Flag multi-site trials explicitly
- Suggest pooling strategy

---

#### **FM-012: Statistical Terminology Accessibility**
- **Category:** User Confusion (Major)
- **Score:** 2 × 2 = 4
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-03, Tester-06

**Issue:** Non-technical users struggle with statistical jargon ("standardized mean difference," "Cohen's d," "intention-to-treat").

**Tester-03:** "I don't have a statistics background. Terms like 'standardized mean difference' meant nothing to me at first."

**Requested Solution:**
- Create glossary of statistical terms with plain-language definitions
- Add inline tooltips/explanations in output
- Provide plain-language output option

---

#### **FM-005: Diagnostic Accuracy Metrics Misread**
- **Category:** Prompt Bug (Major)
- **Score:** 2 × 1 = 2
- **Affected Tester:** Tester-06

**Issue:** Sensitivity value extracted as 0.85 when paper stated 0.82 on Paper-076.

**Root Cause:** Specialized diagnostic accuracy metrics not well-handled by general prompt.

**Note:** Single occurrence but concerning for domain-specific gaps.

---

#### **FM-008: Neuroimaging Outcome Metrics Unfamiliar**
- **Category:** Edge Case (Major)
- **Score:** 2 × 1 = 2
- **Affected Tester:** Tester-04

**Issue:** fMRI metrics and brain activation data not well-extracted. Appropriately labeled yellow/red but indicates knowledge gap.

**Domain-Specific Limitation:** Acceptable but worth noting for neuroscience users.

---

### LOW-PRIORITY ISSUES (Score <2 - Enhancement & User Education)

#### **FM-004: Three-Color Labeling Interpretation (RESOLVED)**
- **Category:** User Confusion (Minor)
- **Score:** 1 × 1 = 1
- **Status:** CLOSED - Resolved via guidance

**Issue:** Tester initially unsure if yellow means "needs review," "likely wrong," or "computed value."

**Resolution:** Added FAQ to documentation clarifying:
- 🟢 = Direct quote (high confidence)
- 🟡 = We calculated this (verify calculation)
- 🔴 = Missing or unclear

---

#### **FM-007: OCR Failure on Graphs/Figures**
- **Category:** Usability (Minor)
- **Score:** 1 × 2 = 2
- **Affected Testers:** Tester-07, Tester-08

**Issue:** Figures and graphs in PDFs not extractable. MAestro skips them without clear indication.

**Tester Quote:** "I had key data in figure format. Would've been nice to know upfront that this couldn't be extracted."

**Resolution:** Document as known limitation; enhance error messaging when figures encountered.

| PDF Quality | Papers | Failure Rate | Avg Time | User Satisfaction |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Excellent** | 35 | 2.9% | 38 min | 4.2/5 |
| **Good** | 32 | 6.3% | 41 min | 3.9/5 |
| **Fair** | 18 | 22.2% | 48 min | 3.2/5 |
| **Poor** | 6 | 57.1% | 62 min | 2.1/5 |

**Correlation:** Poor PDF quality is strongest single predictor of failure and low satisfaction.
**Implication for Story 3.6:** FM-003 (PDF pre-screening) directly addresses biggest pain point.

---

### Pattern 2: Technical Comfort Predicts Error Message Frustration

| Technical Level | Count | Error Message Clarity | Satisfaction | Dropout |
|-----------------|-------|----------------------|--------------|---------|
| **High** | 2 | 3.8/5 | 4.2/5 | 0% |
| **Moderate** | 4 | 3.2/5 | 3.8/5 | 0% |
| **Low** | 1 | 2.1/5 | 2.8/5 | 0%* |

**Finding:** Low-technical-comfort users rated error messages 1.7 points lower than high-comfort users.
**Implication:** FM-002 (error messages) disproportionately impacts accessibility.

---

### Pattern 3: Complex Design Handling Correlates with Discipline

| Discipline | Simple RCT Accuracy | Complex Design Accuracy | Accuracy Gap |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Medical** | 97% | 85% | -12% |
| **Psychology** | 94% | 82% | -12% |
| **Education** | 92% | 71% | -21% |
| **Neuroscience** | 96% | 88% | -8% |
| **Environmental** | 89% | 73% | -16% |

**Finding:** Accuracy drops 8-21% on complex designs; education research worst affected.
**Implication:** FM-009 (multi-arm handling) + FM-006 (multi-site trials) = 12 papers affected.

---

### Pattern 4: Learning Curve Effect on Error Messages

**Data:** Weekly error message clarity ratings (Story 3.5)

| Week | Error Clarity | Confidence | Relationship |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Week 1 | 2.1/5 | 2.9/5 | Low clarity = low confidence |
| Week 3 | 2.8/5 | 3.4/5 | Moderate clarity = growing confidence |
| Week 6 | 3.7/5 | 4.0/5 | Better clarity = high confidence |

**Finding:** Users' confidence tracks error message clarity over time. Improving FM-002 likely improves overall user confidence.

---

### Pattern 5: Feedback Type Correlates with Story References

**Analysis:** Which previous stories' outputs are users complaining about?

| Feedback Type | Story Reference | Testers Affected |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
