# Microscope Extraction Time Measurements

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

**Story:** 1.6 - Test Microscope with Sample Papers
**Purpose:** Track extraction time for each sample paper
**Target:** <5 minutes per typical 8-10 page paper (AC #3)

## Measurement Protocol

**Start time:** When Claude Code conversation begins (prompt + paper pasted)
**Stop time:** When complete data card is generated in output
**Excluded time:**
- Pre-reading/preparing paper
- Saving data card file
- Manual corrections or validation

## Extraction Time Log

| Paper ID | Discipline | Word Count | Pages | Extraction Time | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| _Example: smith_2023_rct_ | _Education_ | _9,500_ | _12_ | _4m 23s_ | _Simple RCT, high quality_ |

## Summary Statistics

_To be calculated after all extractions:_

- **Total papers tested:** [N]
- **Mean extraction time:** [X minutes]
- **Median extraction time:** [X minutes]
- **Range:** [Min] - [Max]
- **Standard deviation:** [X minutes]

### By Paper Length

| Length Category | Mean Time | Count |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Short (6-8K words) |  | [N] |
| Standard (8-12K words) |  | [N] |
| Long (15K+ words) |  | [N] |

### By Complexity

| Complexity | Mean Time | Count |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Simple RCT |  | [N] |
| Complex RCT |  | [N] |
| Quasi-experimental |  | [N] |
| Other |  | [N] |

### By Reporting Quality

| Quality | Mean Time | Count |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| High |  | [N] |
| Medium |  | [N] |
| Low |  | [N] |

## Target Achievement

**Target:** <5 minutes per 8-10 page paper

**Results:**
- Papers meeting target: [N] / [Total] ([X%])
- Papers exceeding target: [N] / [Total] ([X%])
- Average deviation from target: [±X minutes]

## Observations

_Document any patterns or insights:_

- Does extraction time correlate with word count?
- Do complex papers take significantly longer?
- Are there specific paper characteristics that slow extraction?
- Did any papers timeout or require restart?

## Recommendations

_Based on timing results, document:_

- Is <5 minute target realistic for standard papers?
- Should target be adjusted for paper characteristics?
- Are there prompt optimizations that could improve speed?
- What guidance should we provide users on expected times?
