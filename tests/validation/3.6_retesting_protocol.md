# Story 3.6: Re-Testing Protocol

**Purpose:** Validate that Microscope v1.1 refinements resolve original beta issues
**Target:** 2-3 beta testers for focused re-validation
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Focus:** FM-001, FM-003, FM-009 resolutions

## Re-Testing Plan

### Participant Selection
- Tester-01: Experienced (high comfort), reported FM-001 and FM-009
- Tester-02: Expert meta-analyst, reported FM-003
- Tester-04: Moderate user, reported FM-003 and FM-009

### Test Materials
1. **Microscope v1.1 prompt** (with refinements)
2. **3-4 test papers:**
   - 1 large PDF (>20 pages) with potential hallucination risk
   - 1 poor-quality scanned PDF (testing FM-003 pre-screening)
   - 1 multi-arm RCT (testing FM-009 handling)
   - 1 simple RCT (baseline check)

3. **Feedback survey:**
   - Did pre-extraction checklist catch issues upfront? (FM-003)
   - Was multi-arm trial handling clear? (FM-009)
   - Did anti-hallucination safeguards work? (FM-001)
   - What else needs improvement?

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Testers confirm original issues resolved
- ✅ Usability improved vs. v1.0
- ✅ No new issues introduced
- ✅ Willing to recommend v1.1 for beta launch

## Status: Ready for Execution

*Re-testing coordination to begin post-Task 9 regression testing*
