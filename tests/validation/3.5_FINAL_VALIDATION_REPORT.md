### 2.5 Disagreement Pattern Analysis

**Systematic Errors Identified:**

1. **Hallucination on Large PDFs (>20 pages, poor quality)**
   - Occurred: 2/21 papers (9.5%)
   - Example: "Effect size = OR 1.45" reported; paper actually shows OR 1.25
   - Root cause: Context window limitations on lengthy documents
   - Severity: Critical (false data)

2. **Missed Data in Complex Tables**
   - Occurred: 1/21 papers (4.8%)
   - Example: Effect size in supplementary table not extracted
   - Root cause: Microscope prioritizes main text, misses supplements
   - Severity: Major (incomplete extraction)

3. **Outcome Variable Ambiguity**
   - Occurred: 2/21 papers (9.5%)
   - Example: "Depression" extracted; paper reports "CES-D score" (specific measure)
   - Root cause: Microscope uses semantic approximation
   - Severity: Minor (clarifiable)

4. **Statistical Conversion Errors**
   - Occurred: 2/21 papers (9.5%)
   - Example: OR reported; Microscope computed RR with incorrect baseline
   - Root cause: Implicit conversion assumptions not always valid
   - Severity: Major (computed value incorrect)

## 5. THREE-COLOR LABELING EVALUATION

### 5.1 Label Distribution Analysis

**Aggregate Distribution Across All Extractions:**

| Label | Count | % of Total | Expected Range | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| 🟢 Green (Confident) | 539 | 74.0% | 60-70% | Slightly high |
| 🟡 Yellow (Uncertain) | 156 | 21.4% | 20-30% | Within range |
| 🔴 Red (Failed/Missing) | 33 | 4.5% | 5-10% | Slightly low |
| **TOTAL** | **728** | **100%** | — | — |

**Analysis:** Microscope shows slight **overconfidence** (74% green vs. 60-70% expected). This aligns with accuracy findings: 85.7% of papers accurate, but 74% labeled as confident suggests ~11% of green data has minor errors.

### 5.2 False Positive Rate (🔴 when data is correct)

**Process:** For each 🔴 label, manual audit determines if red flag was justified.

**Results:**

| Verdict | Count | % of Red Labels |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| True Positive (correctly flagged error) | 28 | 84.8% |
| False Positive (flagged but data correct) | 5 | 15.2% |
| **Total 🔴 Labels** | **33** | **100%** |

**False Positive Rate: 15.2%**

**Target:** ≤20%
**Status:** ✅ PASS (15.2% < 20%)

**Examples of False Positives:**
- Paper reports "N=100" clearly in abstract; Microscope flags as uncertain (🔴) due to ambiguous wording in methods section
- Effect size reported as "1.45 (95% CI: 1.20-1.70)"; Microscope flags CI width as anomalous (🔴) but CI is correct

**Interpretation:** Red flags are reliable guides; testers can trust them 85% of the time.

### 5.3 False Negative Rate (🟢 when data is wrong)

**Process:** During accuracy validation, identify mismatches between MAestro and gold standard. Categorize by Microscope label (🟢/🟡/🔴).

**Results:**

| Outcome | Count | % of Mismatches |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Mismatch flagged (🟡 or 🔴) | 31 | 71.4% |
| Mismatch NOT flagged (🟢) | 12 | 28.6% |

**False Negative Rate: 28.6%**

**Target:** ≤30%
**Status:** ✅ PASS (28.6% < 30%)

**Examples of False Negatives:**
- Hallucinated effect size labeled 🟢; should have been flagged
- Misread "N per arm" labeled 🟢; should have been 🟡
- Ambiguous outcome (depression vs. PHQ-9) labeled 🟢; should have been 🟡

**Interpretation:** Microscope misses ~29% of errors; users should verify green data for critical fields.

### 5.4 User Trust & Reliance Assessment

**Survey Question: Did you trust the three-color labels?**

| Response | Count | % |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Strongly trust | 2 | 28.6% |
| Somewhat trust | 3 | 42.9% |
| Neutral | 2 | 28.6% |
| **Trust (combined)** | **5** | **71.4%** |

**Spot-Check Behavior (Did you verify green data?):**

| Behavior | Count | % |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Never (fully trusted green) | 1 | 14.3% |
| Rarely (spot-checked key fields) | 2 | 28.6% |
| Sometimes (~50% of papers) | 2 | 28.6% |
| Often (most green data) | 2 | 28.6% |

**Finding:** Majority of testers (71.4%) trust labels, but only 14.3% fully rely on them. 57% spot-check data, showing appropriate skepticism aligned with our 28.6% false negative rate.

### 5.5 Labeling Effectiveness Summary

**Metric Alignment:**

| Metric | Result | Assessment |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Label distribution | 74% green, 21% yellow, 5% red | Slightly overconfident |
| False Positive Rate | 15.2% | Reliable (✅) |
| False Negative Rate | 28.6% | Acceptable, near limit |
| User trust | 71.4% | Moderate-to-strong |
| Spot-check rate | 57% often/sometimes | Appropriately cautious |

**Conclusion:** Three-color labeling system is **effective but imperfect.** Users appropriately balance trust with skepticism. Labels guide review effectively for most papers; occasional misses require user verification on critical fields.

### 6.2 High-Priority Issues (Severity × Frequency ≥6)

**These must be fixed before public launch.**

#### **FM-001: Hallucinated Effect Size on Large/Poor PDFs**
- **Severity:** Critical (3)
- **Frequency:** Widespread - 3 testers (3)
- **Priority Score:** 3 × 3 = **9** ⚠️ HIGHEST
- **Occurrence:** 2/21 gold standard papers (9.5%)
- **Description:** Microscope reports effect size values not present in paper, particularly on papers >20 pages or poor-quality scans
- **Example:** Paper shows OR=1.25; Microscope reports OR=1.45
- **Root Cause:** Context window limitations; hallucination on ambiguous sections
- **Recommendation:** Implement PDF pre-screening; truncate context if needed; flag confidence appropriately
- **Story 3.6 Effort:** High (prompt refinement + validation needed)

#### **FM-002: Unclear Error Messages**
- **Severity:** Major (2)
- **Frequency:** Recurring - 4 testers, 6+ instances (2)
- **Priority Score:** 2 × 2 = **4** ⚠️ HIGH
- **Description:** Error messages don't explain problem or solution; generic "Validation failed"
- **Impact:** Testers spend 15+ minutes troubleshooting instead of retrying
- **Examples:** "Invalid format" (which field?), "Context error" (what to do?)
- **Recommendation:** Add field-level error messaging; include remediation steps
- **Story 3.6 Effort:** Medium (UX improvement)

#### **FM-003: PDF Quality Threshold Handling**
- **Severity:** Major (2)
- **Frequency:** Widespread - 3 testers (3)
- **Priority Score:** 2 × 3 = **6** ⚠️ HIGH
- **Description:** System fails silently or produces poor output on scanned/low-quality PDFs without warning
- **Occurrence:** 5/91 papers (5.5%) had quality issues
- **Impact:** Testers waste time on un-extractable papers
- **Recommendation:** Pre-screen PDFs; warn users upfront if quality below threshold
- **Story 3.6 Effort:** Medium (add pre-screening step)

#### **FM-009: Multi-Arm Trial Effect Size Selection**
- **Severity:** Critical (3)
- **Frequency:** Recurring - 1 blocker, but affects ~15% of papers (2)
- **Priority Score:** 3 × 2 = **6** ⚠️ HIGH
- **Description:** When paper reports multiple effect sizes (arm A vs. control, arm B vs. control), Microscope doesn't clearly handle selection
- **Impact:** Tester unsure which effect size to use; ambiguous extraction
- **Example:** Trial with 3 treatment arms reports 3 effect sizes; Microscope extracts all but doesn't indicate primary
- **Recommendation:** Explicitly flag as multi-arm; ask tester to select primary; extract all with labels
- **Story 3.6 Effort:** Medium (prompt + UI refinement)

**Interpretation:** PDF quality is the #1 blocker. Clear pre-screening guidance needed.

#### **Theme 3: Accuracy & Confidence (Mentioned by 7/7 = 100%)**
"I spotted a few errors—hallucinated numbers on the big papers. Made me cautious." — Tester-02

"Overall accuracy was good, maybe 90%+. But I'm spot-checking critical fields because I found mistakes." — Tester-04

**Interpretation:** Testers acknowledge ~90% accuracy; appropriately skeptical for publication use.

#### **Theme 4: Error Messages & Guidance (Mentioned by 5/7 = 71.4%)**
"When something failed, the error message was cryptic. I'd spend 15 minutes guessing what went wrong." — Tester-03

"It would help to know *why* validation failed, not just that it failed." — Tester-07

**Interpretation:** Error messaging is significant UX pain point needing immediate improvement.

#### **Theme 5: Complex Study Designs (Mentioned by 4/7 = 57.1%)**
"The multi-arm trial was confusing. Microscope extracted all the effect sizes but didn't tell me which was primary." — Tester-04

"My observational studies were trickier than the RCTs. Microscope seemed less sure about design classification." — Tester-06

**Interpretation:** Complex designs not yet well-handled; clear limitation for non-RCT research.

#### **Theme 6: Disciplinary Differences (Mentioned by 3/7 = 42.9%)**
"Psychology uses different outcome metrics than medicine. Microscope seemed tuned for medical papers." — Tester-02

"Education research doesn't fit the typical 'effect size' mold. I had to improvise how to use this." — Tester-03

**Interpretation:** Training data weighted toward medical research; cross-discipline adaptations needed.
