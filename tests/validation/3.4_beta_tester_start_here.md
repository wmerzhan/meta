## What is MAestro?

**AI-powered data extraction for meta-analyses.** Extract structured data (effect sizes, sample sizes, study design) from research papers automatically.

**Does it work?** Yes, but it's MVP (rough edges expected). Your job: be honest about what breaks.

---

## Your Mission (Next 4-6 Weeks)

**Extract 10-20 papers.** Provide weekly feedback. Help us validate and improve MAestro.

| Metric | Target | What You Do |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Accuracy** | ‚â•90% | Spot-check 3-5 papers at end |
| **Time Savings** | ‚â•50% | Log time per paper; compare to your baseline |
| **Bug Reports** | 2-3+ | Report anything broken or confusing |
| **Testimonial** | Optional | Share if you'd recommend it |

**Time commitment:** 2-4 hours per week for 4-6 weeks = ~10-20 hours total

## Weekly Rhythm

Every Friday:
- Extract 2-4 papers (usually)
- Spend 30 min on Friday check-in survey
- Report any bugs
- Optional: attend Monday office hours (live Zoom, optional)

**Response time expectations:**
- Questions: 24-48 hours
- Blocking bugs: 4-6 hours
- Feature requests: Summarized weekly

---

## Getting Unstuck

**"Something doesn't work!"** ‚Üí Post bug report in GitHub Discussions or Discord

**"How do I...?"** ‚Üí Ask in Discussions #questions or Discord #general

**"I need to talk to someone NOW"** ‚Üí Discord direct message or mention @[Founder]

**"I'm confused about X"** ‚Üí Read the relevant guide above, then ask if still unclear

## Key Concepts

### Three-Color Labeling (üü¢üü°üî¥)

MAestro labels confidence levels:
- üü¢ **Green:** High confidence (AI very sure)
- üü° **Yellow:** Medium confidence (plausible, verify)
- üî¥ **Red:** Low confidence (AI guessing, always verify)

**Rule of thumb:** If >80% green fields, data is good. Verify red fields manually.

---

### Accuracy Spot-Check (End-of-Beta)

For 3-5 papers, manually check:
- Effect size matches ‚úì
- Sample sizes match ‚úì
- Authors correct ‚úì
- Study design correct ‚úì

Count matches / total fields = your accuracy %.

Target: ‚â•90% accuracy on each paper.

---

### Time Tracking (Weekly)

Log minutes per paper in end-of-beta survey. Example:
```
Paper 1: 5 min
Paper 2: 6 min
Paper 3: 4 min
Average: 5 min/paper

Your manual baseline: 12 min/paper
Time saved: 58% ‚úÖ
```

---

### Known Limitations (Be Aware)

| Issue | Impact | Workaround |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Large papers (>25 pages) | Might fail | Split paper manually |
| Complex tables | Might extract wrong | Manual review & edit |
| Non-English papers | Likely fails | Translate or skip |
| Scanned images (no text) | Can't process | Convert to searchable PDF first |

**Full list:** See Expectations Document

## Weekly Feedback Survey (5 min)

Every Friday, reply to GitHub Discussions check-in:

```
1. Papers extracted: _____
2. What worked: _______________
3. What frustrated you: _______________
4. Missing features: _______________
5. Overall rating (1-5 stars): ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

**Deadline:** Monday morning. We read all feedback and adjust plans based on patterns.

---

## End-of-Beta Survey (20 min)

At end of Week 5-6, complete comprehensive survey:

**Sections:**
1. Accuracy (spot-check 3-5 papers)
2. Time savings (log summary)
3. Usability rating (clarity of guides, support quality)
4. Bugs & feature requests
5. Testimonial (optional: can we quote you?)

## Celebrating Wins

**Did something go well?** Post in GitHub Discussions #wins or Discord #wins!

Examples:
- "Just extracted 5 papers in 25 minutes! üöÄ"
- "Table extraction worked perfectly on my medical papers"
- "Saved 2 hours vs. manual‚Äîthis is great!"

We love good news. It motivates us and it shows new users what's possible.

## Code of Conduct (TL;DR)

‚úÖ Be respectful
‚úÖ Be specific (not "it doesn't work" but "table extraction failed on merged headers")
‚úÖ Share knowledge with other testers
‚úÖ Don't post research data publicly
‚úÖ Have fun!

‚ùå Don't claim you found a bug if you didn't follow the quick start guide
‚ùå Don't share others' personal data
‚ùå Don't expect instant responses (we're a small team)

## FAQ

**Q: What if I only have time for 10 papers, not 20?**
A: Great! Do what you can. 10 papers = still valuable feedback.

**Q: Is there cost to me?**
A: No! We cover API costs. See Cost Support Plan if you have institutional access.

**Q: What if I find a really important bug?**
A: Report it with context (paper, what you did, what happened, screenshot if possible). We'll prioritize.

**Q: Can I use MAestro after beta testing ends?**
A: That depends on future product decisions. During beta, you have free access. Post-beta, you'd need your own API key (institutional or personal).

**Q: Will my feedback be kept confidential?**
A: Aggregated data is shared. Individual feedback is confidential unless you opt-in to quote publicly.

**Q: What's the worst-case scenario?**
A: You find MAestro isn't ready (low accuracy, bugs, not useful). That's valuable! Tells us what to fix. Honest feedback is more valuable than false praise.

## Your Success = Our Success

You're not just testing a tool; you're shaping its future. Your honest feedback (what works + what doesn't) directly informs the next release.

**The more specific your feedback, the better we can improve.** "Tables broken" is less helpful than "Table extraction fails on merged cells; screenshot attached."
