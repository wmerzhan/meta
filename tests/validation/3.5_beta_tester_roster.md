## Notes on Diversity and Representation

**Intentional Sampling:**
- **Low technical comfort:** Tester-03 and Tester-06 specifically recruited to test usability for non-programmers
- **High meta-analysis expertise:** Tester-05 included as "expert validator" to assess methodological rigor
- **First-time meta-analysts:** Tester-03 and Tester-06 to test as training/learning tool
- **Discipline breadth:** Medical, psychology, education, environmental to test cross-domain applicability

**Limitations:**
- All testers fluent in English (did not test non-English paper extraction extensively)
- All testers at Western institutions (US/Canada/UK)
- Skew toward quantitative research traditions (no qualitative synthesis testers)
