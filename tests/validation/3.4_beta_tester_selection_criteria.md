## Screening Questionnaire

**Instructions:** Send this questionnaire to all interested candidates. Request they complete and return within 3 days. Provide estimated completion time: 10-15 minutes.

### Question 1: Time Commitment (Required/Mandatory)

**Question:** Can you commit 10-20 hours over the next 4-6 weeks to beta testing MAestro?

**Follow-up:** This breaks down as approximately 2-4 hours per week, mostly async (no required meetings). Does this work for your schedule?

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Yes, definitely** → Score: 1 point
- ⚠️ **Maybe, depends on the week** → Score: 0.5 points
- ❌ **No, too busy** → Score: 0 points

**Minimum threshold for this Q:** 0.5+ points (No hard rejection; can work with flexible schedules)

---

### Question 2: Research Project (Required/Mandatory)

**Question:** Do you have an active meta-analysis or systematic review project you'd like to use for testing?

**Context:** If you don't have your own project, we can provide a sample systematic review dataset (esophageal cancer CTC, 14 papers, already selected).

**Scoring:**
- ✅ **Yes, I have an active project** → Score: 1 point

### Question 3: Feedback & Detail Orientation

**Question:** On a scale of 1-5, how comfortable are you providing detailed feedback?

**Context Examples:**
- "This doesn't work" = not enough (score 1)
- "The table extraction fails when there are merged cells. Here's a screenshot." = good (score 4-5)

**Scale:**
- 1-2: Not comfortable (Score: 0 points)
- 3: Somewhat comfortable (Score: 0.5 points)
- 4-5: Very comfortable (Score: 1 point)

**Minimum threshold for this Q:** 0.5+ points

## Scoring & Selection Decision

### Scoring Sheet Template

| Candidate Name | Q1 (Commitment) | Q2 (Project) | Q3 (Feedback) | Q4 (Tech) | Q5 (Discipline) | Q6 (Career) | Q7 (Check-in) | **TOTAL** | **Decision** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jane Doe | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 7/7 | ✅ ACCEPT |
| John Smith | 0.5 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 5.5/7 | ✅ ACCEPT |
| Alice Chen | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 5.0/7 | ⚠️ MAYBE |
| Bob Jones | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 3.0/7 | ❌ REJECT |

### Selection Decision Framework

**Scoring Rules:**

- **5.0-7.0 points:** ✅ **ACCEPT** - Strong candidate
- **4.5-4.9 points:** ⚠️ **MAYBE** - Interview required to assess fit
- **Below 4.5 points:** ❌ **REJECT** - Does not meet minimum requirements

### Acceptance Criteria After Screening

**Target Roster:** 5-10 testers with diversity across:

- **Disciplines:** At least 3 different research fields
- **Career Stages:** Mix of PhD students (30%), postdocs (40%), junior faculty (30%)
- **Technical Levels:** Mix of beginner (20%), intermediate (50%), advanced (30%)

### Interview Questions (For "MAYBE" Candidates)

If a candidate scores 4.5-4.9, conduct a brief 15-minute interview to assess fit:

1. **Commitment Clarification** (if Q1 was ⚠️):
   - "You mentioned variable availability. Walk me through a typical week—when could you realistically carve out 2-4 hours?"
   - Goal: Confirm they can find time, even if not every week is identical

2. **Project Backup** (if Q2 was 0.5 on sample):
   - "If you use our sample dataset, what appeals to you about testing with it vs. your own data?"
   - Goal: Ensure they're genuinely interested, not just looking for a free service

3. **Communication Style** (if Q3 was 0.5):
   - "Can you give me an example of good feedback you've given before? What made it helpful?"
   - Goal: Assess capacity for detailed, structured feedback

4. **Technical Learning Curve** (if Q4 was beginner):
   - "What's your comfort level learning new tools? What would make you feel supported?"
   - Goal: Confirm they're willing to learn and can be self-serve for basic troubleshooting

5. **Availability** (if Q7 was 0):
   - "I understand sync calls don't work. Would you be reliable with async email feedback every week?"
   - Goal: Ensure they'll stay engaged without forced synchronous meetings

### Final Roster Approval

**Founder Approval Workflow:**

1. Score all screening questionnaires
2. Conduct interviews with "MAYBE" candidates
3. Present final roster to founder with:
   - Names and disciplines of testers
   - Diversity breakdown (career stages, technical levels)
   - Justification for selection (why this cohort covers diversity gaps)
4. Founder approves final roster
