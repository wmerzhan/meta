# Story 3.6 - QA Gate Modifications Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** QA Concerns Addressed - Ready for Re-Review
**Quality Score (Previous):** 78/100 (CONCERNS)
**Issues Addressed:** 4/4 Critical & High-Priority Issues

---

## Executive Summary

In response to QA's gate review (Quality Score: 78/100, Status: CONCERNS), we have implemented targeted modifications addressing all four blocking issues identified by Quinn (Test Architect). All changes directly reference QA's specific recommendations.

**QA's Three Options Offered:**
- Option A (Preferred): Real beta testing in parallel
- Option B (Alternative): Accept synthetic data limitations
- **Option C (Implemented): Lite re-testing with internal team + domain experts** ‚Üê Selected as compromise approach

---

## Issue #1: Synthetic Data Dependency
**QA Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### What QA Found
Story 3.5 used synthetic/simulated data, not real testers. Story 3.6 refinements target synthetic feedback patterns, raising questions about real-world applicability.

### Modifications Made

#### 1.1 Story Dev Notes - Data Quality and Validation Strategy (NEW)
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Lines 188-218)

Added comprehensive section documenting:
- **Explicit acknowledgment:** Story 3.5 employed synthetic/simulated beta tester data
- **Impact analysis:** How this affects each AC (AC1-AC6 impact table)
- **Decision documented:** Adopting Option C (Compromise approach)
- **Rationale:** Proceeding with refinements while acknowledging limitations

```markdown
### Data Quality and Validation Strategy (UPDATED per QA Gate Review)

**IMPORTANT: Story 3.5 Data Source - Synthetic vs. Real**

Story 3.5 employed **synthetic/simulated beta tester data** rather than real user validation.
...
**Decision Made (per QA Recommendations):**
Adopting **Option C (Compromise)** approach:
1. Proceed with refinements based on synthetic feedback
2. Conduct lite re-testing with internal team + 2 domain experts
3. Document this limitation in all CHANGELOGs
4. Plan real beta testing as part of Story 3.7
```

#### 1.2 Microscope v1.1 CHANGELOG - Data Source Transparency (NEW)
**File:** `prompts/microscope/CHANGELOG.md` (Lines 38-58)

Added dedicated "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Data Source Transparency" section:
- Explicitly states Story 3.5 used synthetic data
- Clarifies what this means for users
- Provides recommendation for v1.1 use
- Links to Story 3.7 for real-world validation

```markdown
### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Data Source Transparency

**Story 3.5 Validation Used Synthetic Data:**
Story 3.5 employed simulated/synthetic beta tester data rather than real user validation. This means:
- ‚úÖ Refinements address patterns identified in realistic scenarios
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue frequencies may not match actual user experience
- ‚úÖ Regression testing with real papers remains valid
- **Real-world validation planned:** Story 3.7 will conduct actual beta testing
```

### QA Requirement Satisfied
‚úÖ Refinements are no longer presented as universally validated
‚úÖ Users understand the synthetic data limitation
‚úÖ Real-world validation deferred to Story 3.7 (documented)
‚úÖ No false claims of user testing

---

## Issue #2: AC6 Re-Testing Feasibility
**QA Priority:** HIGH (BLOCKING)
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### What QA Found
AC6 requires "‚â•2 beta testers to re-test refined prompts," but Story 3.5 had synthetic testers. Unclear how real re-testing would occur in timeline.

### Modifications Made

#### 2.1 Task 10 Complete Rewrite - Internal Team + Domain Experts
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Lines 88-94)

Completely rewrote Task 10 to address QA's feasibility concern:

**Before:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task 10: Conduct Re-Testing with 2+ Beta Testers (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Subtask 10.1: Invite 2+ beta testers to validate refined prompts
```

**After:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task 10: Conduct Re-Testing with Domain Experts (AC: 6 - MODIFIED APPROACH)
  - [ ] Subtask 10.1: Conduct lite re-testing with **internal team + 2 domain experts** (not external beta testers)
    - **Note:** Story 3.5 used synthetic data; AC6 re-testing with real testers not feasible in timeline. Domain experts validate refinements don't break existing workflows.
    - Select experts from: medicine, psychology, or education domains based on refinement focus areas
  - [ ] Subtask 10.2: Provide re-testers with: refined prompts (v1.1), updated documentation, list of changes made, validation checklist
  - [ ] Subtask 10.3: Request feedback on: (1) refinements don't break existing extraction workflows, (2) new features work as intended, (3) any new issues encountered
  - [ ] Subtask 10.4: Document re-testing results and confirm improvements are stable
```

#### 2.2 Testing Section Updated - Re-Testing Protocol
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Lines 235-239)

Added explicit re-testing protocol section:
```markdown
### Re-Testing Protocol (MODIFIED - Internal Team + Domain Experts)
- Conduct lite re-testing with **internal team + 2 domain experts** (not external beta testers)
  - Rationale: Story 3.5 used synthetic testers; recruiting real testers not feasible in timeline
- Focus on: (1) refinements don't break existing workflows, (2) new features work, (3) identify new issues
- Document re-tester feedback and validation of stability
```

### QA Requirement Satisfied
‚úÖ AC6 is now achievable within timeline (using domain experts instead of recruiting new testers)
‚úÖ Re-testing approach is explicit and documented
‚úÖ Clear rationale explaining why external beta testers not used
‚úÖ Maintains validation rigor through domain expert review

---

## Issue #3: Regression Testing Sample Size
**QA Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### What QA Found
AC7 specified 3-5 papers for regression testing. With 15+ distinct failure modes identified, insufficient coverage of edge cases.

**QA Recommendation:** Increase to 8-10 papers stratified across ‚â•2 disciplines, ‚â•2 complexity levels, ‚â•3 edge cases

### Modifications Made

#### 3.1 Task 9 Expansion - 8-10 Sample Papers with Coverage Matrix
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Lines 81-86)

**Before:**
```markdown
- [ ] Subtask 9.1: Select 3-5 sample papers from Epic 1.6 (diverse disciplines and complexity levels)
```

**After:**
```markdown
- [ ] Subtask 9.1: Select **8-10 sample papers** from Epic 1.6-2.3 (diverse disciplines, complexity levels, and edge cases)
  - Coverage matrix required: ‚â•2 disciplines, ‚â•2 complexity levels (simple RCT + multi-arm), ‚â•3 edge cases (poor PDF, multi-site, large paper)
```

#### 3.2 Testing Section Updated - Explicit Accuracy Metrics
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Lines 228-232)

Updated regression testing standards with explicit metrics:
```markdown
### Regression Testing Standards
- Test all refined prompts with **8-10 baseline sample papers** from Epic 1.6-2.3 (expanded from 3-5 per QA recommendation)
- Coverage matrix: ‚â•2 disciplines, ‚â•2 complexity levels, ‚â•3 edge cases
- Verify all acceptance criteria from previous stories still met
- Three-color labeling validation critical (üü¢/üü°/üî¥ accuracy): FP rate <20%, FN rate <30%
- Output format validation (data cards, CSV/TSV, code generation)
```

### QA Requirement Satisfied
‚úÖ Regression testing expanded from 3-5 to 8-10 papers
‚úÖ Explicit coverage matrix ensures diverse edge case testing
‚úÖ Specific accuracy metrics defined (FP <20%, FN <30%)
‚úÖ Better equipped to catch regressions in untested edge cases

---

## Issue #4: AC2 Refinement Acceptance Criteria
**QA Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### What QA Found
AC2 requires "minimum 5 refinements based on feedback" but doesn't define what counts as a refinement.

**Questions Raised:**
- Is typo fix = 1 refinement?
- Is rewriting ambiguous section = 1 refinement?
- Is adding example = 1 refinement?

### Modifications Made

#### 4.1 Refinement Scoring Criteria Table (NEW)
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Lines 207-218)

Created comprehensive scoring system:

```markdown
**Refinement Scoring Criteria (for AC2 validation):**

AC2 requires "minimum 5 refinements based on feedback." Refinements are scored as follows:

| Refinement Type | Points | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug fix** (prompt misinterprets requirement) | 1 point | Fix hallucination detection, improve multi-arm logic |
| **Clarity improvement** (rewrites ambiguous section) | 0.5 points | Improve error message guidance, clarify confusing instructions |
| **Example addition** (adds concrete example) | 0.25 points | Add worked example for edge case, show before/after |
| **Edge case guidance** (handles discovered failure mode) | 1 point | Add PDF quality checklist, multi-arm trial section |

**Minimum 5 points required across all 3 prompts (Microscope, Compiler, Oracle combined)**
```

#### 4.2 Dev Notes Context Added
**File:** `docs/stories/3.6.refine-prompts-documentation.md` (Line 218)

Clarified minimum point requirement:
```markdown
**Minimum 5 points required across all 3 prompts (Microscope, Compiler, Oracle combined)**
```

### QA Requirement Satisfied
‚úÖ Refinement types are now explicitly defined
‚úÖ Quantitative scoring system eliminates ambiguity
‚úÖ Clear minimum threshold (5 points total)
‚úÖ Tasks 2-4 can now be validated objectively
