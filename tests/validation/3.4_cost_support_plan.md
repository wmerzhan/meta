# Beta Tester Cost Support Plan

## Overview

MAestro uses Claude API for data extraction. This document explains costs, available support paths, and how to manage your budget during beta testing.

---

## Part 1: Cost Transparency

### Claude API Pricing Breakdown

**Claude API Pricing (as of October 2025):**
- Input tokens: $3 per 1 million tokens
- Output tokens: $15 per 1 million tokens

### MAestro Cost Breakdown (from Story 2.6 Case Study)

**Project:** Esophageal cancer systematic review, 14 papers, HR effect size metric

**Cost per component:**

| Component | Papers | Tokens | Cost |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|
| **Microscope** (extraction) | 14 | ~1,000 tokens/paper | ~$0.28 |
| **Compiler** (aggregation) | 1 run | ~500 tokens | ~$0.015 |
| **Oracle** (5 analyses) | 5 | ~800 tokens/analysis | ~$0.060 |
| **TOTAL** | 14 papers | ~15,300 tokens | **~$0.36** |

**Per-paper cost:** ~$0.025 per paper (excluding overhead)

### Scenarios for Your Project

**Scenario A: Small project (10 papers)**
- Microscope (10 papers): ~$0.18
- Compiler: ~$0.01
- Oracle (3 analyses): ~$0.036
- **Total: ~$0.23**
- **You should budget: $1-2**

**Scenario B: Medium project (20 papers)**
- Microscope (20 papers): ~$0.50
- Compiler: ~$0.01
- Oracle (5 analyses): ~$0.060
- **Total: ~$0.57**
- **You should budget: $2-3**

**Scenario C: Large project (50 papers)**
- Microscope (50 papers): ~$1.25
- Compiler: ~$0.01
- Oracle (5 analyses): ~$0.060
- **Total: ~$1.31**
- **You should budget: $3-5**

**Scenario D: Extended testing (100 papers across multiple analyses)**
- Microscope (100 papers): ~$2.50
- Compiler: ~$0.02
- Oracle (10 analyses): ~$0.12
- **Total: ~$2.64**
- **You should budget: $5-10**

### Beta Phase Budget

**Total founder allocation:** $50-100 for entire beta cohort (5-10 testers)

**Assumptions:**
- 10 testers × ~$0.50 per tester (assuming ~20 papers each)
- Buffer for exploration, re-runs, edge case testing
- $50-100 covers 100-200 full projects comfortably

**Your individual allocation:** First, estimate cost from your scenario above, then confirm via support.

## Part 2: Cost Support Mechanisms

### Path A: Institutional Claude Access (Preferred)

**Best for:** If your university/institution has Claude API contracts

#### How to Check

1. **Contact your institution's IT/research computing department:**
   - Ask: "Does our institution have a Claude API contract or partnership?"
   - Many universities negotiate institutional access

2. **Check your research grant:**
   - Some grants have budgets for cloud computing services
   - Claude API costs might be covered by existing compute allocations

3. **Explore alternative institutional arrangements:**
   - University-negotiated discounts with Anthropic
   - Faculty research accounts with pre-funded budgets

#### Benefits of Institutional Access
- ✅ No personal cost
- ✅ Simpler billing (goes through institutional account)
- ✅ Potentially better rates
- ✅ Cleaner separation of personal vs. research expenses

#### How to Use During Beta Testing

**If you have institutional access:**
1. Provide your institution's Claude account information (during onboarding)
2. Use your institutional API key for all Microscope/Compiler/Oracle runs
3. **Important:** Make sure your IT dept knows you're using it for beta testing
4. Track your usage on your side; we'll track aggregate usage on ours

**What to tell your IT department:**
> "I'm beta testing an AI-powered research tool (MAestro) as part of our lab's evaluation of new meta-analysis automation. I'll be using Claude API for this testing, approximately $0.50-2 worth of API calls over 4-6 weeks. Is this covered by our institutional access?"

---

### Path B: Founder-Provided API Credits (Backup Option)

**Best for:** If you don't have institutional access and want to participate

#### How It Works

1. **Pre-testing setup (Week 4):**
   - We generate Claude API key with daily spending limits
   - You use this key during your extraction work
   - Daily limit: $2-3 (prevents accidental overages)
   - Monthly limit tracked across all testers (total $50-100)

2. **During testing (Weeks 5-6):**
   - Use the provided API key for all MAestro commands
   - Your bill: $0 (founder covers it)
   - No out-of-pocket cost for you

3. **Post-testing (Week 6+):**
   - We pay the aggregated bill from all testers
   - Individual tracking available on request

#### Backup: Personal Account with Budget Alerts

If you prefer to use your own Claude account:
1. Set up Claude API account at api.anthropic.com
2. Configure monthly budget limit: $10 (for safety)
3. Enable email alerts: Notify when spend reaches 50%, 75%, 100% of limit
4. During beta testing, you'll spend ~$0.50-3 total (well under $10)
5. **Cost reimbursement:** Email us receipts; we'll reimburse immediately

## Part 3: Setting Up Your Cost Support

### Step 1: Determine Your Support Path (During Onboarding)

**Email template:**

```
Subject: Beta Testing Cost Support Preference

Hi [Your name],

To finalize your beta testing setup, please confirm:

1. Do you have institutional Claude API access available?
   [ ] Yes, my institution has Claude access
   [ ] No, I need the founder subsidy
   [ ] Not sure, let me check

2. If yes to #1, what's your account email?
   ___________________

3. If no/unsure, would you prefer:
   [ ] Founder provides shared API key (we manage costs)
   [ ] I'll use my personal account, you reimburse
   [ ] Other: ___________________

Let me know by [Date] so we can finalize your setup!

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Billing

**If using institutional access:**
- Provide account email
- Get your API key from your IT department
- Test API key with: `maestro test-api-key`

**If using founder subsidy (shared key):**
- We'll send you the API key
- Instructions for installation: See Quick Start Guide
- Test with: `maestro test-api-key`
- Monthly budget limit: Your allocation (usually $2-5)

**If using personal account with reimbursement:**
- Create account: https://api.anthropic.com
- Generate API key
- Configure billing alerts
- Send us your receipts; we reimburse within 5 business days

### Step 3: Track Your Spending

**Location:** `~/.maestro/cost_tracking.csv` (auto-generated by Maestro)

**What it tracks:**
- Date, component (Microscope/Compiler/Oracle), tokens, cost
- Automatically updated after each run
- CSV format; easy to open in spreadsheet

**Example:**
```
date,component,papers,tokens,cost_usd
2025-11-01,Microscope,3,2500,0.075
2025-11-01,Compiler,1,600,0.018
2025-11-02,Microscope,2,1800,0.054
```

**Weekly check:**
- View your cost tracker: `maestro cost-summary`
- Compare to your budget
- Let us know if you're tracking differently than expected

## Part 4: Refund & Reimbursement Policy

### Scenario 1: You Exceed Your Budget

**If your costs run higher than estimated:**

1. **Immediate action:** Contact us in Discord/Discussions
2. **Assessment:** We'll review your usage
3. **Decision (within 24 hours):**
   - **✅ Approve additional budget:** If overage is reasonable (e.g., testing many edge cases)
   - **✅ Cover the overage:** Founder reimburses the extra cost
   - **⚠️ Rate-limiting approach:** We limit your API key to prevent further overage

4. **Follow-up:** Discuss with founder if you want to continue testing or pause

### Scenario 2: You Finish Early & Under Budget

**If you complete 10-20 papers with money left over:**

1. **Option A (Recommended):** Continue testing
   - Explore edge cases with your remaining budget
   - Test additional papers or use cases
   - Maximum benefit from your participation

2. **Option B:** Stop and request refund
   - If you've met the 10-paper minimum, you can stop
   - Remaining budget: rolled back (helps future testers)
   - No refund needed (all costs covered by founder)

3. **Option C:** Use remaining budget for extended testing
   - If you find bugs that need extensive testing to reproduce
   - Extend your participation into Week 7-8
   - Use remaining credits for comprehensive edge case testing

### Scenario 3: You Hit a Blocker & Can't Complete

**If you stop testing early (e.g., technical issues, time constraints):**

1. **Communicate:** Let us know why you're stopping
2. **Data salvage:** Send us any partial work (extraction logs, feedback)
3. **Cost coverage:** All costs incurred are covered; no refund needed
4. **Feedback value:** Even partial participation is valuable; we'll use your feedback

## Part 6: Communication & Support

### Cost-Related Questions

**Q: "I don't understand my bill. Why is it higher than expected?"**
- A: Most common cause: testing with larger papers (>20 pages) or multiple analyses. Share your cost_tracking.csv; we'll review.

**Q: "Can I test on a higher budget?"**
- A: Yes! If you want to test more papers or edge cases, ask us. We have buffer in the $50-100 total budget.

**Q: "What if I accidentally run a very expensive extraction?"**
- A: We monitor for spikes. If we notice unusual usage, we'll check in. If it's accidental, we can revert charges. Don't worry about it.

**Q: "Can I use MAestro after beta testing ends?"**
- A: That depends on future product decisions. During beta, all costs are covered. Post-beta, you'd need your own API key (institutional or personal).

### Reporting

**Where to report cost issues:**
- Discord: #cost-support or DM
- GitHub Discussions: "Cost Support" category
- Email: Direct to founder

**Response time:** 24-48 hours, typically faster

### Your Project Cost Calculator

**Instructions:** Fill in your project details below. This estimates your cost.

**Step 1: Count your papers**
- How many papers will you extract? _____ papers

**Step 2: Estimate token usage**
- Paper length: Average 10-15 pages
- Estimated tokens per paper: 1,000-1,500
- For [#] papers: [#] × 1,000 = _____ tokens

**Step 3: Plan your analyses**
- How many analyses will you run in Oracle? _____ analyses
- Tokens per analysis: ~800 tokens
- For [#] analyses: [#] × 800 = _____ tokens

**Step 4: Calculate total cost**

| Component | Count | Tokens | Cost |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Microscope | _____ papers | _____ | $_____ |
| Compiler | 1 run | 500 | $0.01 |
| Oracle | _____ analyses | _____ | $_____ |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$_____** |

**Cost estimate for your project: $_____ (likely $0.50-3)**

**Budget recommendation: Set aside $[estimate] + $2 buffer = $[total + 2]**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: "Will there be costs after beta testing?"**
- A: That depends on MAestro's future. We're exploring multiple models:
  - Pay-per-use (users own API key)
  - Freemium (limited free tier)
  - Academic licenses (free/discounted for researchers)
  - Institutional partnerships
  - Your feedback will influence which model we choose!

**Q: "What if I want to use my own API key for cost control?"**
- A: Absolutely. Generate your own Claude API key, provide it to us, and we'll reimburse your charges. See "Path B: Personal Account with Reimbursement" above.

**Q: "Can I test without worrying about costs?"**
- A: Yes. Costs are covered by founder subsidy OR institutional access. Your job is testing, not budget management.

**Q: "What's the maximum I might spend?"**
- A: In our most expensive scenario (100 papers + 10 analyses), ~$3-5. We've budgeted $50-100 total for all 5-10 testers, so you won't hit that limit.

**Q: "Is there a risk of surprise costs or runaway bills?"**
- A: Very low. Costs are predictable (tokens scale with papers). Both "shared API key" and "personal account" approaches have spending alerts and daily limits.
