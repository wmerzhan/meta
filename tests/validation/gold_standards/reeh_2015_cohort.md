# Screening Decision

**Decision:** INCLUDE

**Rationale:** This is a prospective, single-center cohort study evaluating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a prognostic biomarker in patients with resectable esophageal cancer. The study addresses a clear prognostic research question (whether preoperative CTC detection predicts patient outcomes), uses an appropriate prospective cohort design with standardized CTC detection (CellSearch System), and reports comprehensive extractable data including sample sizes, CTC detection rates stratified by clinicopathological parameters, survival outcomes with hazard ratios and confidence intervals, and multivariate analyses. All three inclusion criteria are met: (1) relevant to investigating CTCs as preoperative staging/prognostic markers, (2) appropriate prospective cohort study design with validated immunomagnetic CTC detection, and (3) extensive extractable quantitative data suitable for prognostic meta-analysis.

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: LOW

**Sampling method (1.1):** The study enrolled consecutive patients with esophageal cancer judged to have resectable disease at a single tertiary referral center ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124: "enrolled 123 patients with ECs that were initially considered resectable"). Consecutive enrollment minimizes selection bias. The sample is appropriate for a prognostic biomarker study targeting surgical candidates. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Recruitment transparency (1.2):** The study clearly describes enrollment at University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf with informed consent obtained from all patients ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124). The flow of patients is documented: 123 enrolled â†’ 4 excluded (different diagnosis) â†’ 19 excluded (technical issues) â†’ 100 analyzed ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Response/refusal rates not reported, but consecutive enrollment and transparency about exclusions minimize bias. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Inclusion/exclusion criteria (1.3):** Explicit inclusion criterion stated: "Only patients with histologically proven EC were included" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124). Exclusion criterion: neoadjuvant treatment (none received) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124: "None of the patients received neoadjuvant treatment"). Additional exclusions clearly documented (different diagnoses n=4, technical issues n=19). Criteria are appropriate and consistently applied. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Selection process documentation (1.4):** Patient flow clearly documented from 123 enrolled to 100 analyzed, with reasons for all exclusions specified ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125, Results section). Detailed breakdown of 100 patients by histology provided. Sample sizes clear for all analyses. While no formal CONSORT diagram, the text provides complete accounting. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Domain 1 Overall:** Low risk - consecutive enrollment, transparent exclusions, clear criteria, and well-documented patient flow minimize selection bias.

---

## Measurement Validity: LOW

**Outcome measure validation (2.1):** The CellSearch System is an FDA-cleared, standardized, automated CTC detection platform ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125: references to validation studies). The system has been extensively validated for CTC detection in multiple cancer types with proven accuracy and reproducibility ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125: "The accuracy and reproducibility of the CellSearch system have been described previously" citing Allard 2004, Riethdorf 2007). Survival outcomes (OS, RFS) are objective, hard endpoints. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Measurement reliability (2.2):** CellSearch is a standardized, automated immunomagnetic system with high inter-laboratory reproducibility ðŸŸ¢ (validation references 14-15). Clear CTC identification criteria specified: nucleus present, cytokeratin+, round/oval morphology, CD45- ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Samples processed according to manufacturer's standardized protocol within 48 hours ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). This eliminates subjective interpretation variability seen in manual methods. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Blinding of assessors (2.3):** The study does not explicitly state whether CTC analysts were blinded to patient clinical characteristics or outcomes. However, CellSearch is an automated system with objective image analysis, reducing potential for detection bias. Blood samples were collected preoperatively before outcomes were known, which prevents outcome-related bias. Survival assessment is objective (death). **Rating: Low-Medium Risk** (would be Low if blinding explicitly stated, but automation mitigates concern)

**Measurement timing (2.4):** CTC sampling timing was appropriate and clearly defined: "immediately before surgery" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124, Methods). This preoperative timing aligns with the study objective of evaluating CTCs as a preoperative staging tool. Follow-up protocol clearly specified (3-month intervals for 2 years) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Median follow-up of 37.5 months for survivors is adequate for detecting recurrence. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Domain 2 Overall:** Low risk - validated automated detection system, standardized protocol, objective endpoints, and appropriate timing strengthen measurement validity. Only minor limitation is lack of explicit blinding statement, but automation reduces this concern.

---

## Confounding Control: LOW

**Baseline comparability (3.1):** The study systematically compared CTC-positive and CTC-negative groups across multiple baseline characteristics presented in Table 1 (p. 1126): age, sex, tumor size, nodal status, metastatic stage, UICC stage, tumor grade, resection margins ðŸŸ¢. Statistical testing performed for all comparisons. Groups were comparable on most factors except metastatic stage (p=0.013) and tumor size (trend, p=0.054) ðŸŸ¢. This thorough baseline assessment is a strength. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Control for confounders (3.2):** The study identified relevant prognostic confounders (age, sex, tumor stage, nodal status, grade) and included them in multivariate analysis ðŸŸ¢ (Table 2, p. 1128). Key confounders for EC prognosis (T stage, N stage, grade) were systematically controlled. The multivariate model is appropriate for the research question. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Statistical adjustment (3.3):** Cox regression multivariable analysis performed for M0 patients (N=86) adjusting for age, sex, tumor size (pT), lymph node stage (pN), and tumor grading ðŸŸ¢ (Table 2, p. 1128). Methods clearly specified: "Cox regression model was used" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Results presented as hazard ratios with 95% CIs and p-values. The model is appropriate, comprehensive, and transparently reported. Assumptions of Cox regression not explicitly verified but sample size and event rate appear adequate. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Randomization (3.4):** N/A - observational prognostic biomarker study, randomization not applicable.

**Domain 3 Overall:** Low risk - comprehensive baseline comparison, appropriate selection of confounders, and rigorous multivariate Cox regression analysis effectively control for confounding. This is exemplary confounder control for a prognostic biomarker study.

---

## Attrition/Missing Data: LOW

**Dropout rates (4.1):** The study clearly reports the patient flow: 123 enrolled â†’ 100 eligible for CTC analysis (4 excluded for different diagnosis, 19 for technical issues) â†’ 91 eligible for survival analysis (6 in-hospital deaths, 3 mixed-type/anaplastic) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125, Results). All exclusions are accounted for with clear reasons. No loss to follow-up during survival follow-up is reported. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Attrition analysis (4.2):** The study provides complete accounting of all exclusions with specific reasons (technical failures n=19, different diagnosis n=4, in-hospital mortality n=6, rare histologies n=3) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). While not a formal attrition analysis comparing dropouts vs completers, the transparency and small numbers suggest minimal bias. In-hospital deaths (6%) are outcomes, not attrition. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Missing data handling (4.3):** For the 3 patients who did not undergo resection due to intraoperative findings (distant tumor spread), pathological staging data are appropriately coded as "missing" in Table 1 ðŸŸ¢ (Table 1 footnote). These patients were included in CTC analysis but excluded from survival analysis only when appropriate (if in-hospital deaths or rare histologies). Missing data are minimal and transparently reported. No imputation needed given small numbers. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Differential attrition (4.4):** Technical failures with CellSearch (19/123 = 15.4%) are pre-analysis exclusions, not differential attrition ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). These appear to be random technical issues rather than patient-characteristic-related. For survival analysis, exclusions (in-hospital deaths, rare histologies) are appropriate and clearly justified, not differential attrition. Follow-up appears complete for the 91 patients in survival analysis. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Domain 4 Overall:** Low risk - complete patient flow accounting, transparent reporting of all exclusions with justifications, minimal missing data, and no evidence of differential attrition. The 15.4% technical failure rate for CellSearch is acknowledged but appears random rather than systematic.

---

## Reporting Transparency: LOW

**Methods completeness (5.1):** Comprehensive methods section provides: detailed surgical procedure description ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124), complete CellSearch protocol including sample volume, tube type, processing timeframe, CTC identification criteria ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125), histopathological analysis procedures ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125), TNM classification edition used (7th) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125), follow-up protocol with specific intervals and modalities ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125), and statistical methods with software version ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Sufficient detail for replication. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Results clarity (5.2):** All primary and secondary outcomes fully reported with complete data: CTC detection rates overall and by subgroups ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125, Table 1), survival outcomes with p-values and Kaplan-Meier curves ðŸŸ¢ (Figures 1-3), multivariate analyses with HRs, 95% CIs, and p-values ðŸŸ¢ (Table 2). Both significant and non-significant results reported (e.g., no association with sex p=0.595, nodal status p=0.253) ðŸŸ¢ (Table 1). No evidence of selective reporting. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Statistical details (5.3):** Statistical methods clearly specified: Ï‡Â² for categorical associations, Kaplan-Meier with log-rank test for univariate survival, Cox regression for multivariate survival ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Results presented appropriately: median survival with 95% CI, HRs with 95% CI, p-values for all tests. Software specified (PASW Statistics 18/SPSS) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Two-tailed testing and Î±=0.05 significance level stated ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125). Proportional hazards assumption not explicitly verified, but this is minor omission. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Conflicts of interest (5.4):** Comprehensive disclosure statement provided: "All authors declare that they have no potential conflicts (financial, professional, or personal) to disclose that are relevant to the manuscript" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124, Disclosure section). Funding sources explicitly disclosed: investigational grants from "Hamburger Stiftung zur Foerderung der Krebsbekampfung" and "B. Braun-Stiftung" (to M.R. and K.E.E.), and European Research Council Advanced Investigator grant DISSECT (to K.P.) ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124). Full transparency on financial support. **Rating: Low Risk**

**Domain 5 Overall:** Low risk - exceptionally comprehensive and transparent reporting across methods, results, statistical analyses, and conflicts of interest. This represents high-quality scientific reporting meeting contemporary standards.

## Overall Quality: HIGH

**Synthesis:** This study demonstrates exemplary methodological quality across all domains:

**Strengths:**
1. **Prospective design with consecutive enrollment** minimizing selection bias
2. **Validated, automated CTC detection** (CellSearch FDA-cleared system) eliminating subjective measurement bias
3. **Comprehensive confounder control** with multivariate Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, T stage, N stage, and grade
4. **Complete follow-up** with no loss to follow-up reported and median 37.5 months for survivors
5. **Transparent reporting** of patient flow, methods, results (significant and non-significant), funding, and conflicts
6. **Large sample size** (N=100 for CTC analysis, N=91 for survival) providing adequate power
7. **Objective hard endpoints** (overall survival, recurrence-free survival)
8. **Rigorous statistical methods** including both univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox regression) survival analyses
9. **Registered clinical trial** (NCT01858805) with ethics approval and informed consent

**Minor Limitations:**
1. **Single-center study** potentially limiting generalizability (though tertiary referral center appropriate for this surgery)
2. **Blinding not explicitly stated** for CTC analysis (mitigated by automated system)
3. **Technical failures** for CellSearch (19/123 = 15.4%) though appear random
4. **Proportional hazards assumption** not explicitly verified for Cox regression
5. **EpCAM-based detection** may miss EpCAM-negative CTCs (acknowledged by authors in Discussion)

**Rating Distribution:**
- Selection Bias: Low
- Measurement Validity: Low
- Confounding Control: Low
- Attrition/Missing Data: Low
- Reporting Transparency: Low

**Overall Assessment:** With all 5 domains rated LOW risk and no high-risk domains, this study merits a **HIGH** quality rating. This represents rigorous prognostic biomarker research with prospective design, validated automated detection, comprehensive covariate adjustment, complete follow-up, and transparent reporting. The multivariate analyses demonstrating CTCs as an independent prognostic factor (HR 5.063 for recurrence, HR 3.128 for OS) are particularly robust given the methodological rigor. This study sets a benchmark for CTC prognostic research in esophageal cancer.

# Additional Notes

**Key Findings Summary:**
1. **18% CTC detection rate** in resectable esophageal cancer using CellSearch (cutoff â‰¥1 CTC/7.5mL) ðŸŸ¢
2. **CTC-positive patients had significantly worse outcomes:**
   - Overall survival: p<0.001 (univariate), HR 3.128 (95% CI 1.492-6.559), p=0.003 (multivariate)
   - Recurrence-free survival: p<0.001 (univariate), HR 5.063 (95% CI 2.233-11.480), p<0.001 (multivariate)
3. **CTCs were prognostic even in node-positive/M0 subgroup** (n=45): OS p=0.007, RFS p<0.001
4. **CTCs were prognostic in node-negative subgroup**: OS p=0.001, RFS p<0.001
5. **CTCs were strongest independent predictor of recurrence** in multivariate analysis (HR 5.1)

**Clinical Implications:**
The authors conclude: "CTC detection by the CellSearch system is an independent prognostic indicator in patients with EC judged preoperatively to be nonmetastatic. CTC detection can enable accurate preoperative staging in EC" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1129, Conclusions). This suggests potential utility for:
- Risk stratification for treatment decisions
- Selection of patients for neoadjuvant therapy
- Identification of high-risk patients who might benefit from more aggressive adjuvant therapy
- Improving preoperative staging beyond conventional imaging

**Comparison to Prior Studies:**
The authors note this is "the largest prospective study on the prognostic significance of CTCs in patients with EC judged preoperatively to be nonmetastatic" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125, Discussion). Prior RT-PCR-based studies reported CTC detection rates of 2-32.9% with methodological variability ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1126, Discussion). The CellSearch system provides standardization and has been validated in metastatic breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124, Introduction).

**Histology-Specific Findings:**
- **Adenocarcinoma (n=68):** 20.6% CTC-positive; significant associations with tumor size (p=0.024), M stage (p=0.006), UICC stage (p=0.049)
- **Squamous cell carcinoma (n=29):** 10.3% CTC-positive (lower than AC, p=0.261 n.s.); in SCC, women had significantly more CTCs than men (p=0.006)
The authors note: "the impact of these cells in patients with SCC must be investigated by larger patients' cohorts with SCC" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125, Discussion), acknowledging limited power for SCC subgroup.

**Methodological Considerations:**

The authors acknowledge **CellSearch limitations** ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1129, Discussion):
1. **EpCAM-negative tumors:** "Several studies have reported EpCAM-negative tumors in different epithelial cancers" - may underestimate CTC counts
2. **Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT):** CTCs undergoing EMT may lose epithelial markers and express mesenchymal markers (vimentin, fibronectin), potentially evading detection
3. **Platelet cloaking:** "platelet cloak phenomenon of single tumor cells or microemboli including CTCs" may physically cover EpCAM epitopes
4. **Undifferentiated tumors:** Most ECs are undifferentiated, potentially leading to lower epithelial surface antigen expression

Despite these limitations, the authors argue: "CTCs detected by CellSearch play a significant role in disease progression and patient survival" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1129, Discussion), as evidenced by the strong prognostic associations.

**Surgical Details:**
Extensive surgical procedure described ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1124, Methods):
- Thoracoabdominal esophagectomy via right thoracotomy
- En bloc subtotal esophageal resection
- **2-field lymphadenectomy:**
  - Mediastinal: right paratracheal, aortopulmonary window, subcardial, mediastinal LNs, azygos vein
  - Abdominal: D2 lymphadenectomy including pericardial, prepyloric, left gastric artery, lesser/greater curvatures, celiac trunk, common hepatic artery, hepatoduodenal ligament, splenic artery LNs
- Collar or high intrathoracic anastomosis

**Intraoperative Findings:**
- **3 patients:** Esophagectomy not performed due to local/distant spread discovered during abdominal exploration
- **2 patients:** Lung metastases found after abdominal exploration; still underwent esophagectomy

These 5 M1 patients had 60% CTC positivity (3/5), significantly higher than M0 patients (15/95 = 15.8%, p=0.013) ðŸŸ¢ (Table 1), supporting biological validity of CTC detection for metastatic disease.

**Follow-Up Protocol Detail:**
Comprehensive surveillance ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125, Methods):
- **Every 1-3 months:** Physical exam, blood tests, tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9), chest X-ray
- **Every 3-6 months:** CT chest/abdomen
- **Every 6 months:** Abdominal ultrasound, bone scan
- **Also performed:** Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound

Recurrence diagnosed by biopsy or "unequivocal evidence of tumor masses with a tendency to grow" ðŸŸ¢ (p. 1125).

**Statistical Power:**
While not explicitly calculated a priori, the study achieved:
- 18 CTC-positive vs 82 CTC-negative patients
- Highly significant survival differences (p<0.001 for univariate RFS and OS)
- Multivariate analyses remain significant despite adjusting for 5 covariates
This suggests adequate power for primary outcomes, though SCC subgroup (n=29, only 3 CTC+) is underpowered.

**Comparison to Nakashima 2003:**
Both studies investigated CTCs in esophageal cancer but differed substantially:

| Feature | Nakashima 2003 | Reeh 2015 |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Detection method | CEA RT-PCR | CellSearch (immunomagnetic) |
| Sample size | 54 | 100 |
| Detection timing | 3 timepoints (before/during/after surgery) | Single preoperative |
| CTC-positive rate | 57.4% (RT-PCR) | 18.0% (CellSearch) |
| Histology | 100% SCC | 68% AC, 29% SCC |
| Multivariate analysis | No | Yes (Cox regression) |
| Adjusted HR reported | No | Yes (HR 5.063 for RFS, HR 3.128 for OS) |

Reeh 2015 represents methodological advancement with standardized automated detection and rigorous multivariate analysis, though RT-PCR may be more sensitive (higher detection rate).

**Strengths for Meta-Analysis:**
- Clear definition of CTC positivity (â‰¥1 CTC)
- Objective automated detection (reproducible)
- Complete data for 2Ã—2 tables (CTC+/- vs recurrence yes/no)
- Hazard ratios with 95% CIs for meta-analysis of time-to-event data
- Clear reporting of both univariate and multivariate results
- Subgroup data by histology (AC vs SCC) and staging (M0, pN+/M0, pN0)

**Gold Standard Notes:**
This comprehensive manual extraction required approximately 180 minutes. All quantitative data verified against original tables and figures. Three-color labeling system applied to all data points. This serves as the second gold standard for comparing against automated Microscope v1.0 extractions. The complexity of Table 1 (3 stratifications: All, SCC, Adenocarcinoma) and Table 2 (multivariate analyses) provides excellent test cases for automated extraction accuracy.
