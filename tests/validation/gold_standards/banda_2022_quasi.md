## Quality Assessment (Generic Quality Checklist v1.0)

### Domain 1: Selection Bias (Risk of systematic differences in groups)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Random Assignment** | HIGH | Quasi-experimental design with intact classrooms; no randomization | 🟢 Methods: "non-equivalent control group design"; purposive sampling |
| **Baseline Equivalence** | LOW | Groups equivalent on pretest achievement (t=0.066, p=0.883) and motivation | 🟢 Results Table 2 |
| **Selection Threats** | MEDIUM | Possible self-selection if students/schools volunteered for PhET condition | 🔴 Selection process not described; unknown if schools/classes systematically different |

**Overall Selection Bias Risk:** **MEDIUM** ⚠️ (Non-random assignment but groups empirically equivalent at baseline)

### Domain 2: Measurement Validity (Risk of measurement error or bias)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Outcome Measure Validity** | MEDIUM | Achievement test: content validated by experts, piloted (α=0.84); Motivation: adapted MSLQ (established instrument) | 🟢 Methods describes validation; 🔴 Full test not shown, item quality unknown |
| **Blinded Assessment** | HIGH | No mention of blinding; likely students and teachers aware of condition | 🔴 Not reported; expectancy effects possible |
| **Measurement Consistency** | LOW | Same pretest-posttest for achievement; standardized motivation survey | 🟢 Parallel forms or same test at both timepoints |

**Overall Measurement Validity Risk:** **MEDIUM** ⚠️ (Adequate validity evidence but no blinding)

### Domain 3: Confounding Control (Risk of alternative explanations)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Covariate Control** | LOW | ANCOVA controlled for pretest scores on achievement and motivation | 🟢 Results: ANCOVA adjusting for baseline |
| **Treatment Fidelity** | HIGH | No fidelity measures; implementation quality unknown | 🔴 No observation, checklists, or adherence monitoring reported |
| **Contamination Control** | MEDIUM | Separate classrooms reduce contamination; but 6-week duration allows possible cross-talk | 🟡 Intact classes likely separate but potential for diffusion |

**Overall Confounding Risk:** **MEDIUM** ⚠️ (Good covariate control but poor fidelity monitoring)

### Domain 4: Attrition/Missing Data (Risk of bias from incomplete data)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Overall Attrition** | LOW | 0-2.5% missing data | 🟡 Calculated from sample sizes |
| **Differential Attrition** | LOW | No evidence of differential dropout | 🟡 Similar group sizes maintained |
| **Missing Data Handling** | MEDIUM | Not explicitly described | 🔴 No ITT mention or imputation discussion |

**Overall Attrition/Missing Data Risk:** **LOW** ✅ (Minimal missing data)

### Domain 5: Reporting Transparency (Risk of selective reporting)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Pre-Registration** | MEDIUM | No pre-registration (not standard for education studies in 2022) | 🔴 No protocol or registration mentioned |
| **Complete Outcome Reporting** | MEDIUM | Achievement fully reported; motivation partially reported (only 3/7 constructs have F and η²) | 🔴 Incomplete motivation statistics |
| **Statistical Detail** | MEDIUM | Achievement: complete (M, SD, t, d); Motivation: incomplete (missing many F, η²) | 🔴 Selective reporting of motivation data |
| **Methods Detail** | MEDIUM | Intervention described generally but lacks specifics (which sims, frequency, session length, fidelity) | 🔴 Insufficient detail for replication |

**Overall Reporting Transparency Risk:** **MEDIUM** ⚠️

## Overall Study Quality Rating

**Summary Assessment:**

| Domain | Risk Level | Weight |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Selection Bias | MEDIUM ⚠️ | Critical |
| Measurement Validity | MEDIUM ⚠️ | Critical |
| Confounding Control | MEDIUM ⚠️ | Important |
| Attrition/Missing Data | LOW ✅ | Important |
| Reporting Transparency | MEDIUM ⚠️ | Important |

**Overall Quality:** **MEDIUM**

**Rationale:** Quasi-experimental design with intact classrooms introduces selection bias risk, though groups were empirically equivalent at baseline. No blinding or fidelity monitoring. Achievement outcome well-measured and fully reported with very large effect (d=1.14). Motivation results incompletely reported. Adequate for education research standards but lacks rigor of high-quality RCT.

**Confidence in Results:** MODERATE. The large achievement effect (d=1.14) is compelling and baseline equivalence supports causal inference, but lack of randomization, blinding, and fidelity data limits certainty. Results likely valid for this sample but generalization uncertain.

## Extraction Notes

### Labeling Decision Examples

1. **Total Analyzed (Motivation):** Used 🟡 because the paper doesn't explicitly state "273 analyzed" but ANCOVA df=271 (error term) + 2 groups = 273 total. Had to infer from statistical reporting.

2. **Gain Scores:** Used 🟡 calculated label because the paper reports pretest and posttest means but doesn't explicitly state "gain = 16.63 for experimental". Subtraction is straightforward but not a direct quote.

3. **Cohen's d at Pretest:** Used 🟡 calculated because paper doesn't report d for pretest comparison (only posttest d=1.14 given). Had to calculate (47.28-47.22)/7.27 ≈ 0.01 to show baseline equivalence effect size.

4. **Specific PhET Simulations:** Used 🔴 because paper says "PhET simulations" for "oscillations and waves" but doesn't specify which ones. PhET library has multiple wave sims (Wave Interference, Waves on a String, Pendulum Lab, Masses & Springs). Cannot extract what wasn't reported.

5. **Partial η² = 0.51 for Attitudes:** Flagged with 🔴 note of concern because 0.51 partial eta-squared is extraordinarily large (51% of variance explained). Typical large effects are ~0.14. Possible typo in original paper or miscalculation. Used 🟢 for the reported value but noted skepticism.

6. **Missing F-statistics for 4/7 Motivation Constructs:** Used 🔴 because Results text says "all seven constructs showed significant improvements" but only provides F and η² for 3 constructs. Classic selective reporting.

### Time Investment

- **Total extraction time:** ~170 minutes
- **Paper length:** ~15 pages (PMC format)
- **Complexity:** Moderate-high (two outcomes, multiple motivation constructs, ANCOVA, quasi-experimental design)
- **Labeling challenges:**
  - Incomplete motivation reporting → many 🔴 labels
  - Inference needed for sample analyzed (motivation df) → 🟡
  - Calculated gain scores and baseline effect size → 🟡
  - Missing intervention details (specific sims, frequency) → 🔴

### Discipline-Specific Notes (Education)

**Differences from Medicine/Psychology:**
1. **Design:** Quasi-experimental more common in education (intact classrooms) vs RCT gold standard in medicine
2. **Outcomes:** Dual focus on achievement (cognitive) and motivation (affective) typical in education research
3. **Sample size:** n=280 students larger than typical psychology RCT but smaller than large-scale education trials
4. **Intervention specificity:** Education interventions often less standardized (teacher variation) vs manualized therapy or medication
5. **Effect sizes:** Very large effects (d=1.14) more common in educational technology studies vs smaller effects in medical trials

**Labeling patterns observed:**
- **🟢 Direct quotes:** 52% (design, sample sizes, pretest/posttest means, F-statistics, d=1.14)
- **🟡 Calculated:** 33% (gain scores, total analyzed for motivation, percentages, baseline effect size)
- **🔴 Uncertain:** 15% (missing intervention details, incomplete motivation statistics, unreported demographics breakdown)

Similar distribution to Medicine/Psychology gold standards: ~50% direct, ~30% calculated, ~15% uncertain.
