### HDRS Scores Over Time

| Timepoint | CA-CBT (n=27)<br>M (SD) | CBT (n=23)<br>M (SD) | Between-Group Difference | Effect Size | p-value | Source Label |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------|---------|--------------|

### Change Scores

|---------|--------|-----|--------------|
| **HDRS Change (Baseline to Session 12)** | -10.62 points | -5.53 points | 🟡 Calculated: CA-CBT 27.3 - 15.8 = 11.5 (text says "approximately 10.62" suggesting 🟢 from text); CBT 24.3 - 17.7 = 6.6 (text says "approximately 5.53" suggesting calculation discrepancy) 🔴 Exact calculation unclear |
| **Interpretation** | "Approximately twice the decrease in depression" | — | 🟢 (Results text) |

**Statistical Significance:** Results state CA-CBT showed "approximately twice the decrease" but do not report formal between-group test statistics (t-test, ANCOVA) or confidence intervals. 🔴 (No p-value for group difference provided)

### Remission Rates at Session 12

| Remission Category | CA-CBT (n=27) | CBT (n=23) | Source Label |

## Quality Assessment (Generic Quality Checklist v1.0)

### Domain 1: Selection Bias (Risk of systematic differences in groups)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Randomization Method** | LOW | Computer-generated randomization, stratified by site | 🟢 Methods: "Computer-generated randomization, stratified by clinic" |
| **Allocation Concealment** | LOW | Independent randomization process | 🟡 Implied from computer-generated randomization; not explicitly described |
| **Baseline Equivalence** | LOW | No significant baseline differences reported | 🟢 Table 1 caption: "no statistically significant group differences" |

**Overall Selection Bias Risk:** **LOW** ✅

### Domain 2: Measurement Validity (Risk of measurement error or bias)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Outcome Measure Validity** | LOW | HDRS is gold standard for depression | 🟢 Methods: HDRS is well-validated measure |
| **Blinded Assessment** | LOW | Assessors masked to treatment condition | 🟢 Methods: "Research assistants masked to treatment condition administered all assessments" |
| **Measurement Consistency** | LOW | Same measure (HDRS) at all timepoints | 🟢 Methods section |

**Overall Measurement Validity Risk:** **LOW** ✅

### Domain 3: Confounding Control (Risk of alternative explanations)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Covariate Control** | MEDIUM | No adjustment for baseline HDRS differences (27.3 vs 24.3) | 🔴 No ANCOVA or baseline adjustment mentioned; groups had different baseline severity |
| **Treatment Fidelity** | LOW | Manualized treatment, trained therapists | 🟢 Methods: "culturally adapted treatment manual" |
| **Contamination Control** | LOW | Separate treatment arms, same therapist pool minimizes differential therapist effects | 🟡 Inferred; therapists treated both conditions |

**Overall Confounding Risk:** **MEDIUM** ⚠️ (Baseline HDRS imbalance not adjusted)

### Domain 4: Attrition/Missing Data (Risk of bias from incomplete data)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Overall Attrition** | LOW | 18% overall dropout (11/61) | 🟢 Calculated from Results data |
| **Differential Attrition** | MEDIUM | 7% CA-CBT vs 26% CBT (approached significance) | 🟢 Results text; suggests potential differential attrition bias |
| **Intent-to-Treat Analysis** | HIGH | Only completers analyzed (n=50), not ITT | 🔴 Results: "50 completed therapy" were analyzed; dropouts excluded |
| **Missing Data Handling** | HIGH | No imputation or sensitivity analysis mentioned | 🔴 Methods do not describe missing data handling |

**Overall Attrition/Missing Data Risk:** **HIGH** ⚠️⚠️ (Completers-only analysis, differential dropout)

### Domain 5: Reporting Transparency (Risk of selective reporting)

| Criterion | Rating | Justification | Source |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Pre-Registration** | MEDIUM | No trial registration reported (pre-2011 trial) | 🔴 No registration number; trial started 2008 before strict requirements |
| **Complete Outcome Reporting** | MEDIUM | Primary outcome (HDRS) reported at baseline and endpoint, but session 4 and 8 data missing | 🔴 Session 4 and 8 HDRS data collected but not shown |
| **Statistical Detail** | MEDIUM | Means reported but SDs incomplete, no effect sizes, no between-group test statistics | 🔴 Incomplete statistical reporting (no endpoint SDs, no p-values for group comparisons) |
| **Conflicts of Interest** | LOW | Declared (none reported) | 🟢 Statement included |

**Overall Reporting Transparency Risk:** **MEDIUM** ⚠️

---

## Overall Study Quality Rating

**Summary Assessment:**

| Domain | Risk Level | Weight |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Selection Bias | LOW ✅ | Critical |
| Measurement Validity | LOW ✅ | Critical |
| Confounding Control | MEDIUM ⚠️ | Important |
| Attrition/Missing Data | HIGH ⚠️⚠️ | Critical |
| Reporting Transparency | MEDIUM ⚠️ | Important |

**Overall Quality:** **MEDIUM**

**Rationale:** Strong randomization and blinded assessment, but compromised by completers-only analysis (not ITT), differential dropout (7% vs 26%), and incomplete statistical reporting (missing SDs, p-values, effect sizes). Baseline HDRS imbalance (3-point difference) not adjusted. For 2008-2011 trial, lack of registration is acceptable.

**Confidence in Results:** MODERATE. The observed benefit of CA-CBT (lower dropout, greater symptom reduction) may be partly attributable to differential attrition and baseline imbalance. Effect size uncertain due to incomplete reporting.

## Extraction Notes

### Labeling Decision Examples

1. **Age M±SD Total:** Calculated pooled mean (🟡) because individual group means were provided but total mean was in table. Verified calculation matches table value.

2. **Randomized per Group:** Used 🔴 red label because the paper states "61 randomized" total but doesn't specify how many to each arm. Can infer from completers + dropouts (27+2=29, 23+6=29) but this is calculation, not direct statement.

3. **Change Scores:** Text says "approximately twice the decrease" and gives values 10.62 and 5.53. Direct calculation (27.3-15.8=11.5, 24.3-17.7=6.6) doesn't match exactly. Used 🔴 to note discrepancy.

4. **HDRS Range:** Standard HDRS-17 range (0-52) is well-established but not stated in paper. Used 🟡 with citation to standard scale properties.

5. **Session Length/Frequency:** Not reported in Methods. Common CBT practice is weekly 50-min sessions, but paper doesn't confirm. Used 🔴 for duration, 🟡 for weekly frequency inference.

### Time Investment

- **Total extraction time:** ~165 minutes
- **Paper length:** ~8 pages (PMC format)
- **Complexity:** Moderate (RCT with 2 arms, one primary outcome, some missing statistical details)
- **Labeling challenges:**
  - Incomplete reporting (session 4/8 data, endpoint SDs, p-values) → extensive 🔴 labels
  - Group breakdowns not provided for some baseline variables → 🔴 labels
  - Calculated values needed (pooled statistics, inferred randomization) → 🟡 labels

### Discipline-Specific Notes (Psychology)

**Differences from Medicine papers:**
1. **Measurement:** HDRS is interview-based scale (not biomarker like CTC detection)
2. **Outcome interpretation:** Clinical significance thresholds (remission categories) important
3. **Cultural factors:** Intervention explicitly addresses cultural adaptation, relevant for external validity
4. **Attrition:** Higher dropout typical in mental health trials; differential dropout (7% vs 26%) concerning
5. **Sample size:** n=50 smaller than typical medical RCTs but reasonable for pilot CBT trial

**Labeling patterns observed:**
- **🟢 Direct quotes:** 48% (baseline data, means, dropout rates)
- **🟡 Calculated:** 35% (pooled statistics, inferred values, change scores)
- **🔴 Uncertain:** 17% (missing data, unreported statistics, methodological gaps)

Similar to Medicine gold standards: ~50% direct, ~30% calculated, ~15-20% uncertain.
