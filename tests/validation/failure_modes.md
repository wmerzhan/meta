## Executive Summary

This catalog documents **predicted** failure modes for Microscope v1.0 automation, derived from systematic analysis of reporting gaps in cross-discipline gold standards (566 data points analyzed). Since Microscope automation is not yet implemented, predictions are based on:

1. **Systematic ðŸ”´ red label patterns** (21% overall: missing/uncertain data)
2. **Discipline-specific reporting gaps** (Medicine 11%ðŸ”´ vs Education 35%ðŸ”´)
3. **Known LLM limitations** (hallucination, calculation errors, context management)

**Predicted Overall Accuracy:** 85-92% data point agreement with gold standards

**Critical Failure Risk:** 4-8% (incorrect values, hallucinations, major calculation errors)

---

## Failure Mode Categories (7 Types)

Organized by root cause for systematic improvement.

---

## Category 1: Prompt Misunderstanding

_Microscope doesn't follow extraction workflow correctly_

**Predicted Frequency:** LOW (5-10% of extractions) - workflow is structured

### Failure Mode 1.1: Conservative Labeling Not Applied

**Description:** Microscope labels ambiguous/incomplete data as ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡ instead of ðŸ”´

**Predicted Frequency:** 5-8% of uncertain data points

**Severity:** MODERATE

**Examples (from gold standards):**

```
Example 1 (Psychology - Hwang 2015):
Paper states: "approximately twice the decrease in depression"
Gold Standard: ðŸ”´ "Exact change scores not provided; text says ~10.62 and ~5.53 but direct calculation yields different values"
Predicted Microscope: ðŸŸ¡ "Change: 10.62 vs 5.53 (from Results text)"
ERROR: Should be ðŸ”´ due to "approximately" + calculation discrepancy

Example 2 (Education - Banda 2022):
Paper states: "PhET simulations for oscillations and waves"
Gold Standard: ðŸ”´ "Specific simulations not specified (which PhET sims? pendulum lab? wave interference?)"
Predicted Microscope: ðŸŸ¢ "PhET simulations (Methods, p. 4)"
ERROR: Lacks specificity required for replication, should be ðŸ”´
```

**Root Cause:** "When in doubt, use ðŸ”´" rule not strongly enforced; LLM tends toward filling in data rather than flagging gaps

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Manual review of all ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡ labels for precision language ("approximately", "about", etc.)
- **Long-term:** Strengthen prompt with explicit conservative labeling triggers:
  ```
  USE ðŸ”´ (RED) WHEN:
  - Value described as "approximately", "about", "roughly", "~"
  - Intervention details vague (e.g., "weekly sessions" without exact frequency)
  - Sample sizes differ across tables without explanation
  - ANY ambiguity in data interpretation
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #4 (Three-color labeling), AC #5 (Accuracy)

---

## Category 2: Format Violations

_Output doesn't match data card template structure_

**Predicted Frequency:** MODERATE (10-15% of data cards have at least one format issue)

### Failure Mode 2.1: YAML Frontmatter Syntax Errors

**Description:** Malformed YAML preventing parsing

**Predicted Frequency:** 5-10% of data cards

**Severity:** MINOR (easy to fix post-processing)

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Expected:
---
study_id: hwang_2015_rct
extraction_date: 2025-10-21
study_type: rct
---

# Predicted Errors:
---
study_id:hwang_2015_rct  # Missing space after colon
extraction_date: 2025-10-21
study_type: rct
# Missing closing delimiter ---

# OR:
---
study_id: "hwang_2015_rct"  # Unnecessary quotes (valid but inconsistent)
extraction date: 2025-10-21  # Space in key name
---
```

**Root Cause:** YAML syntax strict but LLM sometimes generates valid-looking but malformed structures

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Post-processing YAML validator (Python `yaml.safe_load()`)
- **Long-term:** Provide exact template in prompt with strict format requirements

**Related ACs:** AC #2 (Data card generation), AC #9 (Terminal output)

### Failure Mode 2.2: Markdown Table Alignment Issues

**Description:** Tables with misaligned columns or missing pipes

**Predicted Frequency:** 3-5% of tables

**Severity:** MINOR (rendering issue, data intact)

**Examples:**

```markdown
# Expected:
| Variable | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Age | 45.2 Â± 11.5 | ðŸŸ¢ Table 1 |

# Predicted Error:
| Variable | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Age | 45.2 Â± 11.5 | ðŸŸ¢ Table 1
# Missing final pipe |
```

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Markdown linter/formatter
- **Long-term:** Template examples with clear table structure

---

## Category 3: Hallucinated Data

_Microscope extracted data not present in source paper_

**Predicted Frequency:** LOW but CRITICAL (1-3% of data points)

**Severity:** CRITICAL (introduces false data)

### Failure Mode 3.1: Inferred Intervention Details

**Description:** Microscope infers missing intervention specifics instead of labeling ðŸ”´

**Predicted Frequency:** 2-3% of intervention descriptions (especially Education)

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Examples (from gold standards):**

```
Example 1 (Education - Banda 2022):
Paper: "six weeks on oscillations and waves"
Gold Standard: Session frequency not reported ðŸ”´
Predicted Microscope: "Weekly sessions, 6 weeks total" (HALLUCINATION - "weekly" not stated)

Example 2 (Psychology - Hwang 2015):
Paper: "12 culturally adapted CBT sessions"
Gold Standard: Session duration not specified ðŸ”´
Predicted Microscope: "12 sessions, 50 minutes each" (HALLUCINATION - "50 minutes" is typical CBT but not stated in this paper)
```

**Root Cause:** LLM fills gaps with "typical" or "standard" practices in the discipline

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term (CRITICAL):** Manual verification of ALL intervention details against paper
- **Long-term:** Explicit anti-hallucination directive in prompt:
  ```
  NEVER INFER MISSING DETAILS:
  - Do NOT assume "typical" or "standard" practices
  - If session frequency not stated â†’ ðŸ”´ "Not reported"
  - If materials not specified â†’ ðŸ”´ "Not described"
  - Require EXPLICIT textual evidence for ALL intervention details
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #5 (Accuracy - CRITICAL), AC #6 (Failure modes)

### Failure Mode 3.2: Calculated Values from Insufficient Data

**Description:** Microscope computes values when source data incomplete

**Predicted Frequency:** 1-2% of calculated values

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Examples:**

```
Example (Psychology - Hwang 2015):
Paper: Baseline HDRS: CA-CBT 27.3, CBT 24.3; Endpoint HDRS: CA-CBT 15.8, CBT 17.7
Paper: SDs reported at baseline, NOT at endpoint
Gold Standard: Cannot calculate effect size â†’ ðŸ”´ "Endpoint SDs not reported; cannot compute Cohen's d"
Predicted Microscope: "Cohen's d = 0.35" (HALLUCINATION - calculated using baseline SDs for endpoint, incorrect)
```

**Root Cause:** LLM attempts to "help" by using available data, doesn't recognize insufficiency

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Verify ALL calculations have complete source data
- **Long-term:** Require explicit data source for every calculation input:
  ```
  YELLOW LABEL CALCULATION REQUIREMENTS:
  1. List ALL inputs: "M1 = X, M2 = Y, SD = Z"
  2. Cite source for EACH: "(M1 from Table 2; M2 from Table 2; SD from Table 2)"
  3. If ANY input missing â†’ STOP, use ðŸ”´ instead, explain what's missing
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #5 (Accuracy - CRITICAL)

---

## Category 4: Context Length Issues

_Paper too long, causing truncation or incomplete extraction_

**Predicted Frequency:** LOW with current sample (0% - all papers <15K words)

**Severity:** CRITICAL if occurs

### Failure Mode 4.1: Mid-Extraction Truncation

**Description:** Extraction stops before completing all sections

**Predicted Frequency:** <1% (only for papers >15K words)

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Limit testing to papers <12K words
- **Long-term:** Chunking strategy or paper summarization for long papers

**Related ACs:** AC #2 (Complete data card), AC #3 (Extraction time)

**Note:** None of the 4 gold standards encountered this issue (all 7-15 pages, <12K words)

---

## Category 5: Quality Assessment Errors

_Incorrect domain ratings or missing justifications_

**Predicted Frequency:** MODERATE-HIGH (15-30% disagreement with gold standards)

**Severity:** MODERATE (subjective, but impacts study weight)

### Failure Mode 5.1: Attrition Domain Under-Rating

**Description:** Microscope rates attrition as LOW or MEDIUM when should be HIGH

**Predicted Frequency:** 15-20% of studies with attrition issues

**Severity:** MODERATE

**Examples (from gold standards):**

```
Example (Psychology - Hwang 2015):
Paper: 61 randomized, 50 completed (18% attrition); CA-CBT 7% dropout, CBT 26% dropout
Gold Standard Quality: Attrition Domain = HIGH RISK
  Justification: "Completers-only analysis (n=50, 11 excluded); differential dropout approached significance (7% vs 26%); no ITT analysis"
Predicted Microscope: Attrition Domain = MEDIUM RISK
  Justification: "Overall attrition 18%; dropout rates differ but significance not stated"

ERROR: Missed two critical issues:
1. Completers-only analysis (not ITT) = HIGH risk automatically
2. Differential dropout 7% vs 26% (>10% difference) = HIGH risk signal
```

**Root Cause:** Nuanced criteria for HIGH risk not internalized; lacks specific thresholds (e.g., "differential dropout >10% = HIGH")

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Manual review of Attrition domain for ALL RCTs
- **Long-term:** Add explicit HIGH risk triggers to prompt:
  ```
  ATTRITION DOMAIN - HIGH RISK WHEN:
  - Completers-only analysis (not Intent-To-Treat)
  - Overall attrition >20%
  - Differential attrition >10% between groups
  - Missing data >15% for primary outcome
  - No sensitivity analysis for missing data
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #2 (Quality assessment), AC #7 (Refinements)

### Failure Mode 5.2: Confounding Domain Mis-Rating (Education)

**Description:** Microscope doesn't recognize fidelity/implementation quality issues

**Predicted Frequency:** 20-25% of intervention studies (especially Education)

**Severity:** MODERATE

**Examples (from gold standards):**

```
Example (Education - Banda 2022):
Paper: No fidelity monitoring, implementation fidelity not assessed
Gold Standard Quality: Confounding Domain = MEDIUM RISK
  Justification: "No fidelity monitoring; implementation quality unknown; potential for differential implementation"
Predicted Microscope: Confounding Domain = LOW RISK
  Justification: "ANCOVA controlled for pretest scores"

ERROR: Missed that:
- Fidelity not assessed = confounding risk (teachers may implement differently)
- Statistical control (ANCOVA) doesn't address implementation fidelity
```

**Root Cause:** Confusion between statistical confounding control (ANCOVA) vs implementation confounding (fidelity)

**Mitigation:**
- **Long-term:** Add Education-specific guidance:
  ```
  CONFOUNDING DOMAIN (Education/Psychology Interventions):
  - Check for implementation fidelity assessment (observation, checklists, adherence logs)
  - If fidelity NOT assessed â†’ MEDIUM risk (implementation quality unknown)
  - Statistical control (ANCOVA, propensity matching) does NOT substitute for fidelity monitoring
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #2 (Quality assessment), AC #7 (Refinements)

---

## Category 6: Source Label Errors

_Wrong ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´ classifications or missing evidence_

**Predicted Frequency:** MODERATE (8-15% of labels)

**Severity:** MODERATE (affects transparency, not data values)

### Failure Mode 6.1: Percentages Labeled ðŸŸ¢ When Should Be ðŸŸ¡

**Description:** Percentages stated in text but actually calculated from frequencies

**Predicted Frequency:** 5-10% of percentage values

**Severity:** MODERATE

**Examples (from gold standards):**

```
Example (Medicine - Nakashima 2003):
Paper states: "CTC positivity rate was 57.4%"
Paper also states: "31 of 54 patients were CTC positive"
Gold Standard: 57.4% ðŸŸ¡ "Calculated: 31/54 Ã— 100 = 57.4% (from frequencies p. 165)"
Predicted Microscope: 57.4% ðŸŸ¢ "Results text, p. 165"

ERROR: Even though 57.4% appears in text, it's COMPUTED from 31/54, should show calculation
```

**Root Cause:** Ambiguity when computed values appear in text (looks like direct quote)

**Mitigation:**
- **Long-term:** Clarify labeling decision tree:
  ```
  PERCENTAGE LABELING LOGIC:
  - If percentage stated AND frequencies given â†’ ðŸŸ¡ (show calculation)
  - If percentage stated WITHOUT frequencies â†’ ðŸŸ¢ (direct quote)
  - Exception: "approximately X%" or "about X%" â†’ ðŸ”´ (imprecise)
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #4 (Three-color labeling)

### Failure Mode 6.2: Missing Evidence for Labels

**Description:** Labels applied without required page references or calculations

**Predicted Frequency:** 5-10% of labels

**Severity:** MODERATE (reduces auditability)

**Examples:**

```
Example:
Value: N=280
Label: ðŸŸ¢
Evidence: [MISSING]

Expected: ðŸŸ¢ (Methods, p. 4: "280 Form Three secondary school students")
```

**Mitigation:**
- **Long-term:** Add post-extraction validation checklist:
  ```
  EVIDENCE VALIDATION:
  â–¡ Every ðŸŸ¢ has page/section/table reference
  â–¡ Every ðŸŸ¡ shows complete calculation with sources
  â–¡ Every ðŸ”´ explains what's missing and why
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #4 (Three-color labeling with evidence)

---

## Category 7: Calculation Errors

_Incorrect effect size computations or statistical derivations_

**Predicted Frequency:** MODERATE (3-7% of computed values)

**Severity:** MODERATE-CRITICAL (depends on calculation type)

### Failure Mode 7.1: Pooled SD Calculation Errors

**Description:** Incorrect formula application for pooled standard deviations

**Predicted Frequency:** 3-5% of pooled SD calculations

**Severity:** MODERATE (affects effect size precision)

**Examples:**

```
Example (Medicine - Nakashima 2003):
Given: CTC+ group n1=31, SD1=5.2; CTC- group n2=23, SD2=4.8
Formula: SD_pooled = sqrt(((n1-1)*SD1Â² + (n2-1)*SD2Â²) / (n1+n2-2))
Gold Standard: SD_pooled = sqrt(((30)*27.04 + (22)*23.04) / 52) = sqrt(25.32) = 5.03
Predicted Microscope: SD_pooled = 5.0 (rounding) OR 5.10 (calculation error)
```

**Root Cause:** Complex formula, manual calculation errors

**Mitigation:**
- **Short-term:** Double-check ALL pooled SD calculations
- **Long-term:** Provide standard formulas in prompt with worked examples

**Related ACs:** AC #5 (Accuracy), AC #7 (Refinements)

### Failure Mode 7.2: Effect Size from Insufficient Data

**Description:** Attempting Cohen's d without both means AND SDs at same timepoint

**Predicted Frequency:** 2-3% of effect size calculations

**Severity:** CRITICAL if hallucinated, MODERATE if labeled ðŸ”´

**Examples (from gold standards):**

```
Example (Psychology - Hwang 2015):
Paper: Endpoint means reported (CA-CBT 15.8, CBT 17.7)
Paper: Endpoint SDs NOT reported
Gold Standard: ðŸ”´ "Cannot calculate endpoint effect size; SDs not reported for session 12 HDRS"
Predicted Microscope (ERROR): Cohen's d = 0.30 ðŸŸ¡ (using baseline SDs for endpoint - WRONG)
Predicted Microscope (CORRECT): ðŸ”´ "Endpoint effect size not calculable; means reported but SDs missing"
```

**Mitigation:**
- **Long-term:** Explicit effect size calculation requirements:
  ```
  COHEN'S d REQUIREMENTS:
  - Require: M1, M2, SD1, SD2 (or SD_pooled) AT SAME TIMEPOINT
  - If means without SDs â†’ ðŸ”´ "Cannot calculate d; SDs not reported"
  - NEVER use baseline SD for endpoint calculation
  - NEVER assume SD = SD from another study
  ```

**Related ACs:** AC #5 (Accuracy - CRITICAL)

| **TOTAL** | â€” | **2-6%** | **30-58%** | **10-15%** |

### Predicted Failure Rate by Discipline

| Discipline | Critical Errors | Moderate Errors | Overall Accuracy |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Medicine** | 1-3% | 20-30% | **90-95%** |
| **Psychology** | 3-5% | 35-45% | **85-90%** |
| **Education** | 4-6% | 40-55% | **80-85%** |

**Interpretation:**
- Medicine highest accuracy (clear reporting, table structures)
- Education highest error rate (intervention detail gaps, selective reporting)

### Blocking vs. Non-Blocking

**Blocking Failures** (would prevent Microscope beta launch):
- **NONE PREDICTED** - All critical errors (hallucination, calculation errors) have workarounds (manual review)

**Non-Blocking Failures** (document as known limitations):
- Quality assessment disagreement (15-30%) - subjective, within acceptable range
- Source label errors (8-15%) - transparency issue, not data accuracy issue
- Format violations (10-15%) - post-processing can fix
- Conservative labeling under-application (5-8%) - manual review can catch

**Recommendation:** Microscope v1.0 ready for beta testing with MANUAL REVIEW PROTOCOL for:
1. ALL intervention details (hallucination risk)
2. ALL calculated values (calculation error risk)
3. Attrition domain ratings for RCTs (under-rating risk)
