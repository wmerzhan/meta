  - Multi-arm trial handling section (FM-009)
  - Anti-hallucination safeguards (FM-001)
- **Status:** Ready for production; backward compatible with v1.0

### 3. Compiler/Oracle Status (Tasks 3-4)
- **Action:** Updated CHANGELOG.md for both
- **Status:** v1.0 working as designed; no refinements needed
- **Evidence:** 0 critical/major issues reported in beta

### 4. Prompt Template CHANGELOGs (Task 8)

- **Content:** 15 failure modes with:
  - Descriptions and root cause analysis
  - Mitigation strategies (short/long-term)
  - Severity and frequency assessment
  - Distribution by type and root cause

### 6. Regression Testing Plan (Task 9)
- **File:** `tests/validation/3.6_regression_testing_plan.md`
