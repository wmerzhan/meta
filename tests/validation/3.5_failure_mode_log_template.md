## Master Log Structure

| ID | Date | Tester ID | Category | Severity | Issue Title | Description | Reproduction Steps | Frequency | Unique? | Status | Priority Score (Sev Ã— Freq) |
|----|------|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------|---------|--------|----------------------------|
| FM-001 | 2025-10-29 | Tester-01 | Prompt Bug | Major | Hallucinated effect size | Microscope reported OR=1.5 for field not present in paper | Extract paper with >20 pages, complex tables | First time | Yes | Open | 3 Ã— 1 = 3 |
| FM-002 | 2025-10-30 | Tester-02 | Usability | Minor | Unclear error message | "Validation failed" without context on which field | Run extraction on malformed metadata | Recurring (2x) | No (duplicated FM-001) | Open | 1 Ã— 2 = 2 |

## Categorization Reference

### 1. Prompt Bug (Microscope/Compiler/Oracle)

**Subcategories:**
- **Hallucination:** AI invents data not present in paper
  - Example: Reported sample size of 500 when paper actually says 400
  - Severity: Critical (affects accuracy)

- **Missing Extraction:** Data present in paper, not extracted by AI
  - Example: Effect size visible in table, but not extracted
  - Severity: Major (incomplete extraction)

- **Misinterpretation:** AI misreads paper meaning
  - Example: Confuses outcome variable with covariate
  - Severity: Major (inaccurate extraction)

- **Statistical Error:** AI computes wrong statistic
  - Example: Calculates effect size incorrectly from raw data
  - Severity: Critical (inaccurate extraction)

### 2. Usability Issue

**Subcategories:**
- **Error Message Clarity:** Message doesn't explain problem or solution
  - Example: "Validation failed" without indicating which field
  - Severity: Minor (workaround: manual fix)

- **Workflow Interruption:** Unexpected required input or halt
  - Example: Microscope suddenly asks for clarification user wasn't expecting
  - Severity: Major (interrupts flow, adds time)

- **Data Loss / Persistence:** Work not saved, progress lost
  - Example: Extraction lost after session timeout
  - Severity: Critical (all work lost)

- **Output Formatting:** Emoji rendering, table alignment issues
  - Example: ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ labels not rendering, appear as boxes
  - Severity: Minor (aesthetic, doesn't affect function)

### 3. Edge Case / Context Issue

**Subcategories:**
- **Large Papers (>20 pages):** Context window issues, content gets truncated
  - Example: Last tables not extracted from 30-page paper
  - Severity: Major (incomplete extraction)

- **Poor PDF Quality:** Scanned, image-based, low OCR confidence
  - Example: 50-year-old scanned dissertation, extraction fails
  - Severity: Major (blocks extraction)

- **Non-English Papers:** MAestro trained primarily on English, cross-language issues
  - Example: Spanish study title extracted as gibberish
  - Severity: Minor (title extracted, doesn't block data extraction)

- **Discipline-Specific Reporting:** Field definitions vary by discipline
  - Example: Psychology uses "N=X" differently than epidemiology
  - Severity: Minor (user awareness/instruction needed)

- **Complex Design:** Multi-arm, factorial, adaptive trials not covered in training
  - Example: Factorial 2Ã—2 design confuses extraction logic
  - Severity: Major (incorrect effect size extraction)

### 4. User Confusion

**Subcategories:**
- **Feature Misunderstanding:** User doesn't understand how to use feature
  - Example: User unsure when to use Compiler vs. individual paper extraction
  - Severity: Minor (guidance provided, resolves quickly)

- **Labeling Interpretation:** User confused about ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ meaning
  - Example: User thinks ðŸŸ¢ means "definitely correct" rather than "high confidence"
  - Severity: Minor (leads to overconfidence, but not blocking)

- **Metadata/Guidance Question:** User has question best answered with documentation
  - Example: User unsure whether to extract all outcomes or primary only
  - Severity: Minor (resolved with clarification)

## Severity Ã— Frequency Scoring

**Priority = Severity Level Ã— Frequency Multiplier**

| Severity | Level | Frequency | Multiplier | Example Priority Score |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| Critical | 3 | First time | 1 | 3 Ã— 1 = 3 (flag for immediate fix) |
| Critical | 3 | Recurring (2x) | 2 | 3 Ã— 2 = 6 (high priority) |
| Critical | 3 | Widespread (3+ testers) | 3 | 3 Ã— 3 = 9 (highest priority) |
| Major | 2 | First time | 1 | 2 Ã— 1 = 2 |
| Major | 2 | Recurring (2x) | 2 | 2 Ã— 2 = 4 |
| Major | 2 | Widespread (3+ testers) | 3 | 2 Ã— 3 = 6 |
| Minor | 1 | First time | 1 | 1 Ã— 1 = 1 |
| Minor | 1 | Recurring (2x) | 2 | 1 Ã— 2 = 2 |
| Minor | 1 | Widespread (3+ testers) | 3 | 1 Ã— 3 = 3 |

**Action Thresholds:**
- Score â‰¥9: Fix immediately, may block public launch
- Score 5-8: Fix before public launch, plan for Story 3.6
- Score 2-4: Document for Story 3.6 backlog
- Score 1: Document for future consideration

## Weekly Debrief Checklist

**During weekly sync call with tester:**

```
[ ] "What broke this week? Any errors or unexpected behavior?"
[ ] "What confused you most?"
[ ] "Did you encounter any papers you couldn't extract?"
    [ ] If yes: What made that paper difficult?
[ ] "Were there any moments where you thought 'this should work but doesn't'?"
[ ] "Any improvements you'd suggest based on this week's experience?"

ACTION ITEMS:
[ ] Record any new failure modes in master log
[ ] Categorize and score priority
[ ] If Critical: Troubleshoot immediately
[ ] If Major: Plan fix for before launch
[ ] If Minor: Add to backlog
```

## Deduplication Rules

When consolidating failure modes across testers:

1. **Same error, different tester = 1 entry, mark as "Recurring"**
   - Example: Three testers report "hallucinated effect size on >20 page PDFs"
   - Log once: "PDF size >20 pages causes hallucination", Frequency: "Widespread (3 testers)"

2. **Different manifestation, same root cause = 1 entry with variations**
   - Example: One tester reports "Missing field A", another reports "Missing field B", both from same paper type
   - Log once: "Missing field extraction for [paper type]", note both fields affected

3. **User confusion resolved via guidance = Close, document in "User Confusion" category**
   - Example: Tester asked question, answered in debrief, no code change needed
   - Log: Category "User Confusion", Status "Closed - guidance provided"

4. **Cannot reproduce or tester error = May close with note**
   - Example: Tester reports "data lost" but actually closed without saving
   - Log: Category "User Error" (not a bug), Status "Closed - user error"
