4. **Support each other:** If you know the answer to a peer's question, help out! We're building a community.

## Part 3: Day 1 - Onboarding Call Agenda

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

**Attendees:** All beta testers (or individual calls if group doesn't work)

**Slides/Materials:**
- Slide 1: Welcome & MAestro vision (2 min)
- Slide 2: What is beta testing? (3 min)
- Slide 3: Your role & timeline (5 min)
- Slide 4: Walkthrough of materials (10 min)
- Slide 5: Support & communication channels (5 min)
- Slide 6: Q&A (10 min)

**Talking Points:**

> "Thank you all for volunteering! MAestro is an AI-powered tool to extract data from research papers automatically. We're validating that it works across different disciplines and research methodologies. Your job is to be honest: Does it work? Where does it break? What would make it better?
>
> Over the next 4-6 weeks, you'll extract 10-20 papers. We're tracking three things: accuracy (does it match the papers?), time savings (how much faster is it?), and usability (is it easy to use?). Don't worry about publication-grade perfection; we're testing the tool, not your meta-analysis.
>
> We'll check in weekly, either sync call or async email, your choice. We'll cover: what worked, what frustrated you, what we should know. And we want to hear about bugs, feature ideas, edge cases, everything.
>
> You have support: guides, community chat, direct support. We aim for 24-48 hour response on questions. Anything blocking you, let us know immediately.
>
> This is MVP quality. Rough edges expected. We'll refinalize the tool based on your feedback. Your feedback directly shapes what we build next."
