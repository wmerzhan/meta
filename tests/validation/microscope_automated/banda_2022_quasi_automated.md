# Screening Decision: INCLUDE

**Rationale:**
This quasi-experimental study evaluates the effectiveness of PhET interactive simulations for teaching physics in Malawi secondary schools. The study provides empirical quantitative data comparing experimental (PhET simulations) vs. control (traditional teaching) groups on achievement and motivation outcomes. Design is appropriate for educational intervention research, and sufficient statistical data is reported for meta-analysis extraction.

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: MEDIUM

**Non-random assignment:** Study used intact classes randomly assigned to conditions (ðŸŸ¢ Methods, p. 2), not individual randomization. This is quasi-experimental design, introducing moderate selection bias risk. **MEDIUM RISK**

**Baseline equivalence:** Pretest scores showed no significant difference (p=0.946, ðŸŸ¢ Table 1), suggesting comparability despite non-random assignment. **LOW RISK for this aspect**

**Overall Domain:** MEDIUM RISK due to quasi-experimental design despite baseline equivalence.

---

## Measurement Validity: LOW

**Validated instruments:** Achievement test and motivation measures not described in detail; psychometric properties not reported (ðŸ”´ Methods, p. 3). **MEDIUM RISK**

**Content validity:** Achievement test covered taught content (oscillations and waves, ðŸŸ¢ Methods, p. 3), demonstrating content alignment. **LOW RISK**

**Overall Domain:** LOW RISK (content-aligned assessment, though validation details lacking)

---

## Confounding Control: MEDIUM

**Baseline comparability:** Groups equivalent at pretest (p=0.946, ðŸŸ¢ Table 1). **LOW RISK**

**Design limitations:** Quasi-experimental design cannot control unmeasured confounders like teacher quality, class culture, school resources (ðŸ”´ inherent to design). **MEDIUM RISK**

**Statistical control:** No mention of controlling for confounding variables in analysis (ðŸ”´ Methods/Results). **MEDIUM RISK**

**Overall Domain:** MEDIUM RISK (baseline balance but limited confounding control)

---

## Attrition/Missing Data: LOW

**Attrition rates:** No attrition reported; all 280 participants appear to have been analyzed (ðŸŸ¡ Table 1, p. 4). **LOW RISK**

**Missing data:** Not discussed; Tables 1 and 3 show complete data for all participants (ðŸŸ¡). **LOW RISK**

**Overall Domain:** LOW RISK (appears to be complete data with no dropout)

---

## Reporting Transparency: MEDIUM

**Methods completeness:** Design, setting, participants, intervention generally described but lacks specificity (which PhET sims? session frequency? test validation?) (ðŸ”´ Methods, p. 2-3). **MEDIUM RISK**

**Results completeness:** Achievement results fully reported with means, SDs, t-tests, effect size (ðŸŸ¢ Table 1). Motivation results partially complete: first 3 constructs have statistics, last 4 missing t-statistics (ðŸ”´ Table 3). **MEDIUM RISK**

**Overall Domain:** MEDIUM RISK (selective reporting, methodological details missing)

---

## Overall Quality: MEDIUM

**Synthesis:** Study demonstrates adequate methodological quality for educational quasi-experiment. Strengths include baseline equivalence, large sample (N=280), complete achievement outcome reporting, and very large effect size. Limitations include non-random assignment, incomplete intervention description, missing validation evidence, and selective statistical reporting for motivation outcomes.

Mix of LOW RISK (Measurement Validity, Attrition) and MEDIUM RISK (Selection Bias, Confounding Control, Reporting Transparency) supports **MEDIUM quality rating**. Results are credible but should be interpreted with awareness of quasi-experimental limitations.

# Additional Notes

**Strengths:**
- Large sample size (N=280)
- Baseline equivalence demonstrated
- Very large effect size for achievement (d=1.14)
- Multiple motivation outcomes assessed
- Clear practical significance for education technology

**Limitations:**
- Non-random assignment (quasi-experimental)
- PhET simulations not specifically identified (limits replication)
- Intervention fidelity not assessed
- Missing statistical details for 4/7 motivation constructs
- No follow-up assessment (only immediate posttest)

**Meta-Analysis Implications:**
- Excellent data for achievement outcome (pretest/posttest M, SD, effect size)
- Can extract: Cohen's d = 1.14, t = 9.532, p < 0.01
- Motivation data partially extractable (3/7 constructs complete)
