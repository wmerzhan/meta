# Screening Decision: INCLUDE

**Rationale:**
Prospective cohort study investigating prognostic value of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Provides empirical data with defined exposure (CTC presence), outcome (recurrence/survival), and extractable statistics. Appropriate observational design for prognostic marker research.

# Quality Assessment Justifications

## Selection Bias: MEDIUM

Consecutive patient enrollment from single center (游릭 Methods, p. 515) reduces selection bias, but single-center design limits generalizability. **MEDIUM RISK**

## Measurement Validity: LOW

CTC detection using RT-PCR for CEA mRNA is validated method (游릭 Methods, p. 515-516). Sensitivity 1:10^7 documented. Outcome (recurrence) objectively defined. **LOW RISK**

## Confounding Control: MEDIUM

Cohort design; no randomization. Univariate analysis performed for multiple prognostic factors (游릭 Table 3) but multivariate adjustment not clearly reported (游댮). **MEDIUM RISK**

## Attrition/Missing Data: LOW

Appears complete follow-up for all 54 patients; no mention of loss to follow-up (Results). **LOW RISK**

## Reporting Transparency: MEDIUM

Methods well-described for CTC detection. Results report univariate analyses clearly (游릭 Table 3) but multivariate results incomplete (游댮). Recurrence outcomes well-documented. **MEDIUM RISK**

## Overall Quality: MEDIUM

Cohort study with validated biomarker detection, objective outcomes, apparent complete follow-up (LOW RISK: Measurement Validity, Attrition). Limitations: single-center, limited confounding control, incomplete multivariate analysis (MEDIUM RISK: Selection Bias, Confounding Control, Reporting Transparency). **Overall MEDIUM quality.**

# Additional Notes

**Strengths:**
- Prospective design with consecutive enrollment
- Validated CTC detection method (RT-PCR)
- Multiple timepoint sampling
- Complete follow-up apparent
- Objective outcome (recurrence)

**Limitations:**
- Single-center study (generalizability)
- Small sample (N=54)
- Multivariate analysis not fully reported
- No survival hazard ratios provided

**Meta-Analysis Implications:**
- Can extract: CTC positivity rates, recurrence associations, p-values
- Cannot extract: Hazard ratios (HR) with confidence intervals for multivariate model
