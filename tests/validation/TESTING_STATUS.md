# Story 1.6 Testing Status

<!-- Powered by BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core -->

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Story Status:** In Progress (BLOCKED - Awaiting Research Papers)

## Infrastructure Setup: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

All testing infrastructure and documentation templates have been created and are ready for empirical testing.

## What's Been Created

### 1. Paper Selection Framework
**File:** `tests/validation/paper_selection_criteria.md`

Comprehensive criteria for selecting 5-10 representative test papers:
- 3+ disciplines (medicine, psychology, education)
- 4+ study design types (simple RCT, complex RCT, quasi-experimental, meta-analysis)
- Word count diversity (8-12K standard, one 15K+ stress test)
- Reporting quality variation (high/medium/low)
- Statistical complexity range
- Table density variation

### 2. Gold Standard Extraction Documentation
**File:** `tests/validation/gold_standards/README.md`

Framework for creating manual "gold truth" extractions:
- Process for manual data card creation
- Error taxonomy for comparison (8 error types)
- Quality standards for gold standard extractions
- Naming conventions and storage structure

### 3. Extraction Time Tracking
**File:** `tests/validation/extraction_time_log.md`

Template for measuring Microscope extraction speed:
- Measurement protocol (start/stop timing)
- Log table for each paper
- Summary statistics calculations
- Analysis by paper length, complexity, and quality
- Target achievement tracking (goal: <5 minutes)

### 4. Labeling Coverage Analysis
**File:** `tests/validation/labeling_coverage_analysis.md`

Framework for analyzing three-color labels (üü¢üü°üî¥):
- Per-paper coverage tracking
- Aggregate statistics across all papers
- Coverage by paper characteristics (quality, design, discipline)
- Label evidence quality assessment
- Uncertainty flagging effectiveness (goal: 90%+ uncertain data flagged)
- Misclassification analysis

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Results Template
**File:** `tests/validation/1.6_microscope_testing_results.md`

Master template for documenting all testing outcomes:
- Executive summary
- Sample papers tested (characteristics, selection rationale)
- Gold standard extraction results
- Extraction time analysis
- Labeling coverage statistics
- Accuracy metrics vs. gold standards
- Failure mode summary
- Prompt refinement decisions
- Sample data card catalog
- Terminal output validation results
- Overall assessment (ready for beta?)

### 6. Failure Mode Catalog
**File:** `tests/validation/failure_modes.md`

Structured template for documenting issues:
- 7 failure categories (prompt misunderstanding, format violations, hallucinations, context length, quality errors, label errors, calculation errors)
- Frequency and severity tracking
- Root cause analysis
- Mitigation strategies (short-term workarounds, long-term fixes)
- Blocking vs. non-blocking classification
- Recommendations for prompt refinements

### 7. Terminal Output User Testing Protocol
**File:** `tests/validation/terminal_output_user_testing.md`

User testing framework for non-technical researchers:
- Test scenario and protocol
- Evaluation criteria (6 aspects: emoji visibility, markdown rendering, YAML clarity, error messages, instructions, confusion points)
- Cross-platform testing (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Quantitative metrics (task completion, time, satisfaction)
- Recommendations for documentation updates

### 8. Source Papers Documentation
**File:** `examples/sample_meta_analysis/source_papers/README.md`

Template for documenting test papers:
- Paper selection criteria summary
- Copyright considerations
- Paper profile template (citation, characteristics, rationale)
- Usage instructions for learning
- Testing results summary

## What's Needed Next: RESEARCH PAPERS

To proceed with empirical testing, we need **5-10 actual research papers** that meet the selection criteria.

### Required Papers

**Minimum requirements:**
1. **At least 3 disciplines:**
   - Medicine (clinical trials)
   - Psychology (behavioral interventions)
   - Education (learning interventions)
   - Optional: Public health, social work, nutrition

2. **At least 4 study designs:**
   - 2+ simple RCTs (8-10 pages, clear structure)
   - 1+ complex RCT (>12 pages, multiple outcomes)
   - 1+ quasi-experimental/observational study
   - 1+ meta-analysis/review (for testing exclusion)

3. **Word count diversity:**
   - Majority: 8,000-12,000 words (6-7 papers)
   - Short: 6,000-8,000 words (1 paper)
   - Long: 15,000+ words (1 paper - stress test)

4. **Reporting quality mix:**
   - High quality: 2-3 papers (CONSORT compliant, complete data)
   - Medium quality: 3-4 papers (typical, some missing data)
   - Low quality: 1-2 papers (substantial missing data)

### How to Provide Papers

**Option 1: PDF Files**
- Place PDFs in `examples/sample_meta_analysis/source_papers/`
- Naming: `{first_author}_{year}_{short_title}.pdf`
- Ensure copyright allows redistribution

**Option 2: Citations/DOIs**
- Update `examples/sample_meta_analysis/source_papers/README.md` with:
  - Full APA citations
  - DOI or access links
  - Paper characteristics (discipline, design, word count, etc.)
  - Selection rationale

**Option 3: Temporary Access**
- Provide papers for testing without committing to repository
- Agent will test and document results
- Papers can be removed after testing

### Gold Standard Subset

From the 5-10 papers, **select 2-3** for manual "gold standard" extraction:
- One simple RCT (baseline comparison)
- One medium-quality paper (real-world representative)
- One from each core discipline (if possible)

These will be manually extracted to establish ground truth for accuracy measurement.

## Testing Workflow (Once Papers Obtained)

1. **Document papers** in source_papers/README.md
2. **Create gold standards** (2-3 papers, ~2-3 hours each)
3. **Run Microscope extractions** (all 5-10 papers)
4. **Measure extraction times** (log in extraction_time_log.md)
5. **Analyze labeling coverage** (count üü¢üü°üî¥ in each data card)
6. **Compare to gold standards** (identify errors, calculate accuracy)
7. **Document failure modes** (categorize issues)
8. **Recruit user testers** (2-3 non-technical researchers)
9. **Conduct user testing** (terminal output validation)
10. **Compile results** (complete 1.6_microscope_testing_results.md)
11. **Decide on refinements** (create v1.1 or document known issues)
12. **Add sample data cards** to examples/
13. **Update documentation** (microscope-usage.md)

## Questions?

**Where do I find suitable papers?**
- PubMed Central (open access): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/
- Google Scholar
- University library databases
- Preprint servers (PsyArXiv, EdArXiv)

**What if I don't have access to papers?**
- Use open access papers from PMC
- Request papers via institutional library
- Use preprints (check license)

**Can I use papers I've already published?**
- Yes! Perfect for testing
- You know the "ground truth" intimately
- Can serve as high-quality gold standard

**How long will testing take?**
- Gold standard creation: 2-3 hours per paper (2-3 papers = 6-9 hours)
- Microscope extractions: ~5 minutes per paper (10 papers = ~50 minutes)
- Labeling analysis: 1-2 hours
- User testing: 2-3 hours (recruiting + sessions)
- Results compilation: 2-3 hours
- **Total: ~15-20 hours of focused work**
