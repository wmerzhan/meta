# Beta Testing Goals & Metrics

## Overview

This document explains what we're validating during the beta testing phase, how we'll measure success, and how we'll share results with you.

**Core principle:** Your feedback will directly shape the next iteration. We're building this with you, not just testing on you.

---

## Part 1: The Four Beta Testing Goals

### Goal 1: Validate 90% Extraction Accuracy üìä

**What:** MAestro extracts data that matches the original papers

**Why it matters:** If extraction is inaccurate, the whole tool fails. Your confidence in the results depends on accuracy.

**How we measure:**
1. You extract 10-20 papers using Microscope
2. We ask you to manually spot-check 3-5 papers
3. For each paper, you verify key fields:
   - Effect size (e.g., HR, OR, SMD)
   - Sample size (n)
   - Authors
   - Study design (RCT, cohort, case-control, etc.)
   - Study duration (if applicable)
4. Count matching fields / total fields = accuracy %

**Target:** ‚â•90% of your spot-checked papers show ‚â•90% agreement with originals

**Example:**
```
Paper 1 (10 fields checked): 9 match = 90% ‚úÖ
Paper 2 (8 fields checked): 8 match = 100% ‚úÖ
Paper 3 (12 fields checked): 10 match = 83% ‚ö†Ô∏è
Paper 4 (10 fields checked): 9 match = 90% ‚úÖ
Paper 5 (9 fields checked): 8 match = 89% ‚ö†Ô∏è

Result: 4/5 papers (80%) at ‚â•90% accuracy
Status: Borderline‚Äîneed more data or targeted improvement
```

**What you do:**
- Complete end-of-beta accuracy survey (see onboarding package)
- Provide accuracy % for 3-5 papers
- Note any systematic problems (e.g., "table extraction always fails on merged headers")

---

### Goal 2: Measure Time Savings üïê

**What:** MAestro is faster than manual extraction

**Why it matters:** A tool that saves hours is valuable. Time savings justify adoption.

**How we measure:**
1. You track time spent per paper during extraction
2. We ask: "How long would this normally take you manually?"
3. Calculate: (baseline time - MAestro time) / baseline time = % savings

**Target:** ‚â•50% time savings across all testers

**Example:**
```
Your baseline (manual): 15 minutes per paper
MAestro time: 5 minutes per paper
Time saved per paper: 10 minutes
% saved: (10 / 15) √ó 100 = 67% ‚úÖ

Cumulative (20 papers):
Manual: 300 minutes (5 hours)
MAestro: 100 minutes (1.67 hours)
Total time saved: 200 minutes (3.33 hours) ‚úÖ
```

**What counts as time saved:**
- ‚úÖ Running Microscope extraction
- ‚úÖ Reviewing and accepting results
- ‚úÖ Manual fixes for obvious errors
- ‚ùå Doesn't count: Compilation, analysis (separate tools)

**What you do:**
- Log time on each paper (use the time tracking template)
- Provide your baseline time estimate
- Report total savings in end-of-beta survey

---

### Goal 3: Identify Failure Modes üêõ

**What:** Find things that break or don't work as expected

**Why it matters:** Failure modes inform refinement priorities (Story 3.6). The more we know about what breaks, the better we can fix it.

**How we measure:**
1. You report bugs/issues as you encounter them
2. We track across all 5-10 testers
3. Count distinct failure modes (not duplicate reports)
4. Categorize by severity: critical, major, minor

**Target:** Identify 10-20 distinct failure modes across entire beta cohort

**Examples of failure modes:**
```
Failure Mode 1: Table extraction fails on merged cells
- Frequency: ~5% of papers
- Severity: Major (workaround: manual entry)
- Papers affected: Chemistry, physics journals

Failure Mode 2: Context window exceeded (papers >25 pages)
- Frequency: ~2% of papers
- Severity: Critical (can't extract)
- Workaround: Split paper manually

Failure Mode 3: Non-English papers return empty results
- Frequency: ~3% of papers
- Severity: Major (expected with non-English, not supported)
- Workaround: Translate or skip

Failure Mode 4: Confidence labeling inconsistent on text tables
- Frequency: ~8% of papers with text tables
- Severity: Minor (output still usable, just uncertain confidence)
- Workaround: None needed, just be aware

[... 16+ more ...]
```

**What you do:**
- Report bugs using GitHub bug report template
- Include: what broke, when, on which paper, severity
- Help us reproduce when possible (screenshot, paper example, etc.)

---

### Goal 4: Gather Testimonials üé§

**What:** Real researchers saying whether MAestro is valuable

**Why it matters:** Testimonials support our case that the tool is useful. They're more convincing than our claims.

**How we measure:**
1. End-of-beta survey includes open-ended questions
2. We ask for permission to quote publicly
3. We collect 5-8 quotes from diverse disciplines/career stages

**Target:** 5-8 usable quotes; at least 3 public-permissioned quotes

**Examples of testimonials we're looking for:**
```
"This saved me 5 hours on literature review. I can now spend that time on analysis."
‚Äî Dr. Jane Smith, Psychology postdoc

"I was skeptical, but it really works. I used it for my meta-analysis and it cut my extraction time in half."
‚Äî Prof. Bob Chen, Medical school, China

"Not perfect, but incredibly useful for exploratory work. I'd recommend it to colleagues doing systematic reviews."
‚Äî Sarah Johnson, PhD student, Education
```

**What you do:**
- Answer end-of-beta testimonial questions
- Optional: Allow us to quote you
- Be honest: "It's good but needs X" is great; it's more credible than pure praise

## Part 2: Metrics Dashboard

### Live Tracking Spreadsheet

**You'll receive access to a shared spreadsheet tracking:**

| Tester | Discipline | Career | Tech Level | Papers | Accuracy % | Time/Paper (min) | Bugs Found | Rating (1-5) |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jane Doe | Medicine | Postdoc | Intermediate | 18 | 92% | 5.2 | 3 | 4.5 |
| John Smith | Psychology | PhD Student | Advanced | 20 | 95% | 4.8 | 5 | 5 |
| Alice Chen | Education | Faculty | Beginner | 12 | 87% | 6.1 | 2 | 4 |
| Bob Garcia | Econ | Postdoc | Intermediate | 15 | 90% | 5.5 | 4 | 4 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **AGGREGATE** | **5 fields** | **3+ disciplines** | **Mixed** | **65+** | **91%** | **5.2 avg** | **14** | **4.5 avg** |

**What this shows:**
- ‚úÖ Are we hitting 90% accuracy target? (Aim for aggregate ‚â•90%)
- ‚úÖ Is time savings real? (Aim for <6 min/paper average)
- ‚úÖ Are we finding failure modes? (10-20 total across cohort)
- ‚úÖ Is satisfaction reasonable? (Aim for ‚â•4/5)

**Transparency model:**
- You can see all aggregated data
- Individual tester data is confidential (only you see yours)
- We share results with testers at end of beta
- Results inform Story 3.6 priorities

üü° MAJOR (frequently requested):
- [ ] Add discipline-specific templates (4 testers, different disciplines)
- [ ] Support non-PDF documents (3 testers)
- [ ] Better error messages (6 testers complained)

üü¢ NICE-TO-HAVE (1-2 requests):
- [ ] Metadata extraction
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Export to different formats

Based on: Beta testing feedback from [8 testers], [14 bugs], [22 feature requests], [65 papers extracted]
```

---

### Post-Refinement (Publication & Marketing)

**Accuracy improvements:**
- "Beta testing showed 91% extraction accuracy on real-world papers. Story 3.6 improved this to 95%+."

**Testimonials:**
- Product page features 3-5 beta tester quotes
- Release notes acknowledge contributions

**Academic documentation:**
- Paper on tool evaluation: "Validated with 8 beta testers across 5 disciplines..."
- You may be co-author or acknowledged (depends on your contribution level)

---

## Part 4: Transparency Commitments

### What We Promise

‚úÖ **Honest reporting:**
- We'll report what actually worked, not what we hoped for
- Example: "Accuracy was 89%, shy of our 90% target. Here's why..."
- Bad results are still valuable for understanding limitations

‚úÖ **No cherry-picking:**
- We won't exclude bad feedback or low-accuracy papers
- All data is reported and explained

‚úÖ **Open communication:**
- We'll share results (aggregated, anonymized)
- We'll explain how your feedback shapes priorities
- We'll be honest about timelines and resource constraints

‚úÖ **Continued engagement:**
- Beta testers get first access to refinements
- We'll ask for follow-up testing feedback
- Optional ongoing community involvement

### What We Won't Do

‚ùå **We won't:**
- Claim higher accuracy than we actually achieved
- Ignore critical bugs or issues
- Make promises we can't keep
- Use your data without permission
- Prioritize ego over evidence

---

## Part 5: FAQ on Goals & Metrics

**Q: "What if accuracy is only 85%, not 90%?"**
A: That's valuable data! We'll know to focus Story 3.6 on accuracy improvements. Lower accuracy informs refinement priorities.

**Q: "What if time savings are less than 50%?"**
A: That tells us either our baseline estimate was wrong, or there are workflow inefficiencies we need to address. Both are useful.

**Q: "What if you don't find 10-20 failure modes?"**
A: 5-10 failure modes is still progress. Fewer issues = fewer refinements needed. Either way, we'll have validation data.

**Q: "Will you publish results of beta testing?"**
A: Likely in academic context (paper on tool evaluation). Testers acknowledged. You can see draft before publication if you want.

**Q: "What if results are negative (low accuracy, no time savings)?"**
A: We'll be honest about it. That's why we beta test: to find real problems before wider release. Negative results drive improvements.

**Q: "Can I see other testers' feedback?"**
A: Aggregated data: yes (see dashboard above). Individual feedback: no (confidential). We'll share themes: "3 testers reported table extraction issues."
