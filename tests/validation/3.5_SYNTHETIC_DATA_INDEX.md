## Data Characteristics

### Realism & Internal Consistency

**Realistic Patterns:**
- Learning curve: First papers slower, later papers faster
- Technical comfort correlation: Low-tech users slower initially
- PDF quality impact: Poor PDFs → more yellow/red labels, longer extraction times
- Domain familiarity: Specialized metrics (neuroimaging, oncology) → more uncertainty
- Experience effect: Expert meta-analysts faster and more accurate

**Internally Consistent:**
- Time logs match usability ratings (satisfaction improves as extraction time decreases)
- Accuracy results match labeling distribution (74% green, 85.7% ≥90% accuracy)
- Failure modes correspond to accuracy mismatches (hallucination on Paper-049 = FM-001)
- Qualitative themes match quantitative metrics (PDF quality theme = 27.5% papers with blockers)

## Data Limitations

**This is synthetic/simulated data for validation purposes.**

**Limitations:**
- Not based on real user testing (simulated realistic patterns)
- Gold standard sources are illustrative (not actual published reviews)
- Tester quotes are synthesized (not verbatim from real interviews)
- Time logs follow realistic distributions but are not actual measurements

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrate validation methodology for Story 3.5
- Provide template for actual beta testing execution
- Illustrate realistic outcomes and edge cases
- Support QA gate review and acceptance criteria validation

**For Actual Beta Testing:**
- Replace synthetic data with real tester data
- Conduct actual interviews and collect verbatim quotes
- Validate gold standards against published sources
- Measure actual extraction times and accuracy rates
