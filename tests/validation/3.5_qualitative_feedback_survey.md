## FEEDBACK ANALYSIS PROCESS

**Week 8:** After collecting all interviews/surveys

### 1. Thematic Coding

Read through all responses and code for themes:

```
THEMES IDENTIFIED:
- Theme: "Time savings" (mentioned by X testers, X% of sample)
- Theme: "PDF quality issues" (mentioned by Y testers)
- Theme: "Error messages unclear" (mentioned by Z testers)
- Theme: "Would use for exploration but not publication" (mentioned by...)
- [etc.]
```

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

Overall sentiment by tester:

| Tester ID | Overall Sentiment | Would Recommend | Trust Level | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Tester-01 | Very Positive | Yes | High | Enthusiastic, minor issues |
| Tester-02 | Positive | Yes, with caveats | Moderate | Time savings key benefit |
| Tester-03 | Neutral | Maybe | Low | Frustrated with errors |
| Tester-04 | Negative | No | Low | Multiple blockers |

**Summary:**
- X testers positive/enthusiastic
- Y testers neutral/mixed
- Z testers negative/frustrated

### 3. Quote Extraction

Pull 2-3 most compelling quotes per theme for report:

```
SAMPLE QUOTES FOR REPORT:

On Time Savings:
"MAestro saved me hours every week. Even with fact-checking, it's
probably 50% faster than doing it all manually." - Tester-01

On Frustrations:
"The error messages were cryptic. I'd spend 15 minutes guessing what
went wrong instead of just trying again." - Tester-03

On Recommendation:
"I'd recommend this to anyone doing a rapid scoping review, but not
for systematic reviews that need publication-grade data." - Tester-02
```

### 4. Discrepancy Analysis

Compare quantitative metrics to qualitative feedback:

```
CONSISTENCY CHECK:

If testers report high satisfaction but only 60% complete 10+ papers:
  → Why? (Time constraint vs. low motivation)

If testers report low trust but high accuracy:
  → Why? (Over-cautious, or did they not verify extractions?)

If testers report time savings but 40-minute average:
  → Compare to self-reported baseline (manual time)
```

### 5. Use Case Characterization

Based on feedback, identify who MAestro is best suited for:

```
RECOMMENDED USE CASES:
✓ Rapid literature scoping (exploration-grade)
✓ Researcher new to systematic reviews (training tool)
✓ Large-scale screening (batch extraction with manual verification)
✓ Single-arm observational studies
✓ Well-formatted RCT papers

CAUTIONED USE CASES:
⚠ Publication-grade meta-analyses (needs more validation)
⚠ Complex multi-arm trials (extraction errors observed)
⚠ Low-quality PDFs (scanned documents)
⚠ Non-English papers (training data gap)

NOT RECOMMENDED YET:
✗ Sole data source for systematic review
✗ Qualitative research extraction
✗ Highly specialized designs (adaptive trials, N-of-1)
```
