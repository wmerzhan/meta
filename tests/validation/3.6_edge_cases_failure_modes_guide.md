## HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES (Severity × Frequency ≥6)

### FM-001: Hallucinated Effect Sizes on Large/Poor PDFs
- **Priority Score:** 9 (Highest)
- **Severity:** Critical (3) × Frequency Widespread (3) = 9
- **Papers Affected:** 2/21 gold standards (9.5%)
- **Testers Affected:** 2 out of 7

**Mitigation:** Microscope v1.1 anti-hallucination safeguards, PDF pre-screening

---

### FM-003: PDF Quality Threshold Handling
- **Priority Score:** 6
- **Severity:** Major (2) × Frequency Widespread (3) = 6
- **Papers Affected:** 5/91 (5.5%)
- **Testers Affected:** 4 out of 7

**Mitigation:** Microscope v1.1 pre-extraction checklist

---

### FM-009: Multi-Arm Trial Effect Size Ambiguity
- **Priority Score:** 6
- **Severity:** Critical (3) × Frequency Recurring (2) = 6
- **Papers Affected:** ~15% of sample with multi-arm designs
- **Testers Affected:** 3 out of 7

**Mitigation:** Microscope v1.1 explicit multi-arm trial handling

---

### FM-002: Unclear Error Messages
- **Priority Score:** 4 (Borderline)
- **Severity:** Major (2) × Frequency Recurring (2) = 4
- **Impact:** 4+ testers, 6+ instances
- **Testers Affected:** 4 out of 7

**Mitigation:** Documented in Best Practices guide; UX/frontend refinement needed

## Failure Mode Distribution

### By Issue Type
- **Prompt Bug:** 4 (FM-001, 005, 009, 014)
- **Usability:** 5 (FM-002, 007, 008, 012, 015)
- **Edge Case:** 4 (FM-003, 006, 010, 013)
- **User Confusion:** 2 (FM-004, 011) - BOTH RESOLVED

### By Root Cause
- **LLM Limitations:** FM-001 (hallucination), FM-005 (metric misread)
- **Documentation Gaps:** FM-002, FM-012 (terminology, error messages)
- **Design Limitations:** FM-003 (no pre-screening), FM-006, FM-009 (no multi-arm logic)
- **Domain-Specific:** FM-007, FM-013 (unfamiliar metrics), FM-014 (cluster RCT detection)
- **User Training:** FM-004, FM-008, FM-011 (misunderstanding; resolved via education)
