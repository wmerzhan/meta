## Versioning Convention

Microscope follows semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MINOR:** New features, additional guidance, improved instructions
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes, clarifications, typo corrections

**Important:** Always use the same Microscope version throughout a single meta-analysis project for consistency.
