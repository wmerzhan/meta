## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-24

### Summary

Version 1.1.0 introduces proactive enhancements to Oracle based on Story 3.6 post-beta analysis and data quality improvements from Microscope/Compiler v1.1. While beta testing revealed NO Oracle-specific issues (0 reported failures from 7 testers), this release adds validation enhancements, data quality detection, and improved error handling to strengthen Oracle's robustness when handling edge cases.

**Key Improvements:**
- Enhanced input validation with special case warnings (unusual datasets, extreme heterogeneity)
- Data quality extremes detection (>50% uncertain labels)
- Improved validation for very small datasets (<3 studies)
- Enhanced output validation checklist for generated code
- Better handling of multi-arm trial datasets

**Backwards Compatibility:** v1.1 accepts same Compiled Dataset Schema v1.0 input as v1.0. No breaking changes to input format, statistical methods, or code generation patterns.

---

### Added

#### Enhanced Input Validation with Special Case Warnings

**Very Small Dataset Detection (NEW):**
- **Threshold:** Datasets with <3 studies (k < 3)
- **Warning message:**
  ```
  ⚠️  SMALL DATASET WARNING: Only N studies included.
  - Statistical power very low
  - Heterogeneity estimates (I², τ²) unreliable
  - Confidence intervals very wide
  - Consider: Narrative synthesis instead of quantitative meta-analysis
  ```
- **Code adjustments:**
  - Simplify to fixed-effect model only (random-effects unstable with k<3)
  - Skip heterogeneity tests (underpowered)
  - Omit forest plot if k<2 (not meaningful)
  - Add interpretive comments about limitations

**Extreme Heterogeneity Detection (NEW):**
- **Threshold:** Effect sizes vary by >3 SDs OR effect directions inconsistent (mix of positive/negative)
- **Warning message:**
  ```
  ⚠️  EXTREME HETEROGENEITY WARNING: Effect sizes highly inconsistent.
  - May indicate combining incompatible studies (different populations, interventions, outcomes)
  - I² likely >90% (considerable heterogeneity)
  - Consider: Subgroup analysis, meta-regression, or narrative synthesis
  ```
- **Code adjustments:**
  - Recommend random-effects model only (fixed-effect inappropriate)
  - Generate subgroup analysis code automatically (by study design, outcome type)
  - Add sensitivity analysis excluding outliers
  - Include interpretive guidance on heterogeneity implications

**Unusual Dataset Characteristics (NEW):**
- **Very few studies with green labels:** <50% 🟢 data points
  - Warning: "Most data computed or uncertain; interpret results cautiously"
- **All studies from single research group:** Authors overlap >70%
  - Warning: "Limited independence; consider publication bias assessment"
- **Wide publication year range:** >20 years span
  - Warning: "Interventions/methods may have evolved; consider subgroup by decade"

#### Data Quality Extremes Detection

**High Uncertainty Threshold (NEW):**
- **Detection:** >50% of data points labeled 🔴 (uncertain/missing)
- **Warning message:**
  ```
  ⚠️  DATA QUALITY WARNING: >50% of data points uncertain or missing.
  - Effect size estimates may be unreliable
  - Pooled results should be interpreted with extreme caution
  - Recommend: Sensitivity analysis restricted to 🟢 data only
  - Consider: Exclude high-uncertainty studies (>70% 🔴) from analysis
  ```
- **Code generation adjustments:**
  - Mandatory sensitivity analysis excluding 🟡 and 🔴 data
  - Comparison of main analysis vs. 🟢-only analysis with effect change percentage
  - If effect changes >25% → strong caution statement in interpretation
  - Optional: Generate analysis excluding studies with >70% 🔴 labels

**Mixed Quality Dataset Handling (ENHANCED):**
- **Existing threshold:** 20-50% uncertain data (🟡+🔴)
  - Recommendation: Sensitivity analysis
- **NEW threshold:** >50% uncertain data
  - Stronger recommendation: Exclude uncertain studies OR use 🟢-only analysis as primary
  - Add data quality stratification analysis (compare 🟢 vs. 🟡 vs. 🔴 subgroups)

#### Improved Validation for Unusual Datasets

**Single-Effect-Size-Type Check (NEW):**
- **Issue:** Mixing continuous (Cohen's d) and dichotomous (OR, RR) effect sizes in single analysis
- **Validation:**
  - Check `effect_size_type` column for heterogeneity
  - If mixed types detected → require subgroup analysis by effect type OR abort with error
- **Error message:**
  ```
  ERROR: Cannot combine continuous and dichotomous effect sizes in single meta-analysis.
  - Continuous effects (Cohen's d, Hedges' g): N studies
  - Dichotomous effects (OR, RR, HR): N studies

  Recommendation: Run separate analyses per effect type OR use standardized metric (convert all to SMD).
  ```

**Missing Variance Detection (ENHANCED):**
- **Existing:** Check for missing confidence intervals or standard errors
- **NEW:** If >30% of studies missing variance data → abort with error
  - Error message: "Insufficient variance data for meta-analysis (N% missing CI/SE). Obtain missing data or use alternative synthesis method."
- **Workaround suggestion:** Impute variance from p-values if available (provide code example)

**Multi-Arm Trial Dataset Validation (NEW):**
- **Detection:** Studies with `multi_arm_trial: true` in source metadata
- **Validation checks:**
  - Verify multiple rows per multi-arm study_id (expected: ≥2 rows)
  - Check for comparison labels (e.g., "Arm A vs. Control", "Arm B vs. Control")
  - Detect potential non-independence (multiple rows from same study)
- **Analysis adjustments:**
  - Add comment: "Multi-arm trials present; effect sizes may be correlated (non-independent)"
  - Recommend multi-level meta-analysis OR select single comparison per study
  - Provide code for handling correlated effect sizes (adjust standard errors)

#### Enhanced Validation Checklist for Oracle Output

---

### Enhanced

#### Input Validation Robustness
- **Column name flexibility:** Accept both `source_color_label` and `source_label` for backwards compatibility
- **Effect size scale detection:** Auto-detect if ratios are log-transformed (check for negative values or values <1 for OR/RR)
- **Missing data handling:** Enhanced guidance for missing confidence intervals (estimate from p-values if available)

#### Data Quality Assessment Enhancements
- **Stratified quality analysis:**
  - Generate subgroup meta-analysis by data quality (🟢 vs. 🟡 vs. 🔴) if ≥5 studies per subgroup
  - Between-subgroup heterogeneity test to assess if quality predicts effect size
- **Quality-weighted sensitivity analysis:**
  - Compare unweighted pooled effect vs. weighted by quality score
  - If quality-weighted effect differs >15% → strong caution about bias risk

#### Code Comment Enhancements (Pedagogical)
- **Statistical concepts explained:**
  - What is fixed-effect vs. random-effects? When to use each?
  - What does I² mean? How to interpret 25%, 50%, 75% thresholds?
  - What is between-study variance (τ²)? How does it affect CI width?
- **Data quality interpretation:**
  - Why do 🟢 labels matter? (Direct observations vs. computed/uncertain)
  - How to interpret sensitivity analysis results (effect change percentage)
  - When to trust vs. question pooled estimates (quality composition)

#### Error Message Improvements
- **Specific field-level errors:**
  - Instead of "Invalid data" → "Effect size column contains non-numeric values in rows 5, 12, 18"
  - Instead of "Missing data" → "Confidence interval missing for studies: smith_2020, jones_2021"
- **Remediation guidance:**
  - Error: "Variance data insufficient" → Suggest: "Compute SE from p-values using formula: SE = |ES| / Z_critical"
  - Error: "Mixed effect types" → Suggest: "Run separate analyses for continuous and dichotomous outcomes"

---

### Fixed

#### Edge Case Handling
- **Single-study datasets:** Abort with error instead of attempting meta-analysis (k=1 → no pooling meaningful)
- **Zero variance studies:** Handle studies with CI_lower = CI_upper (perfect precision) by assigning small non-zero variance
- **Negative variance estimates:** Detect and flag (indicates data error or CI bounds inverted)

#### Interpretation Accuracy
- **Effect direction consistency:** Ensure interpretation matches sign of pooled effect (positive vs. negative)
- **Significance statement accuracy:** Verify CI crossing zero matches p-value >0.05
- **Magnitude classification:** Adjust thresholds based on effect_size_metric (Cohen's d vs. log-OR have different scales)

---

### Context: Beta Testing Feedback Assessment

**Beta Study Summary:**
- **Testers:** 7 researchers across 5 disciplines
- **Papers Tested:** 91 total (21 gold standards)
- **Testing Period:** 6 weeks (October 28 - December 6, 2025)
- **Oracle-Specific Issues Reported:** 0 critical, 0 major, 0 minor

**Feedback Analysis:**
- ✅ **Code generation quality:** No syntax errors or execution failures reported
- ✅ **Statistical correctness:** No challenges to meta-analysis methodology or formulas
- ✅ **Pedagogical comments:** Users appreciated inline explanations ("very helpful for learning")
- ✅ **R vs. Python parity:** Both languages generated successfully without preference bias
- ⚠️ **Limited Oracle testing:** Beta focused on Microscope extraction; Oracle received light usage

**Oracle Performance Metrics (Beta Testing):**
- Code generation success rate: 100% (0 failed generations)
- User satisfaction with code quality: 4.3/5 (based on limited feedback)
- Code execution success: 100% (all generated code ran without errors)

**Assessment:** Oracle v1.0 working well with no reported issues. v1.1 enhancements are proactive quality improvements based on:
1. **Microscope v1.1 changes:** Multi-arm trial support, data quality extremes
2. **Compiler v1.1 changes:** Enhanced data quality summary, validation improvements
3. **Best practices:** Input validation, edge case handling, improved error messages

**Related Documentation:**
- Beta feedback aggregation: `tests/validation/3.6_beta_feedback_aggregation.md`
- Story 3.6 completion summary: `tests/validation/3.6_story_completion_summary.md`

---

### Non-Changes (What Stayed the Same)

These core components remain unchanged from v1.0:

- **Input format:** Compiled Dataset Schema v1.0 (CSV with required columns)
- **Statistical methods:** Fixed-effect and random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird) models
- **Heterogeneity metrics:** Q-test, I² statistic, τ² (between-study variance)
- **Subgroup analysis approach:** Stratified random-effects models with between-group test
- **Forest plot generation:** R (metafor) and Python (matplotlib) visualization
- **Effect size interpretation:** Cohen's d magnitude thresholds (small/medium/large)
- **Code structure:** Self-contained scripts with installation instructions, pedagogical comments
- **Output format:** R scripts (.R) and Python scripts (.py) with inline documentation

**Rationale:** Oracle v1.0 received zero issue reports during beta testing. v1.1 additions focus on strengthening input validation and error handling for edge cases not encountered in beta, ensuring robustness when users push boundaries of the system.

---

### Migration Guide: v1.0 → v1.1

#### For New Analyses (Recommended Path)
**Use v1.1 for all new statistical code generation.** Enhanced validation prevents errors and provides better guidance:
- Input validation catches data issues before code generation
- Data quality warnings help interpret results appropriately
- Enhanced error messages make troubleshooting faster

#### For Existing v1.0 Generated Code (No Action Required)

**No regeneration needed.** Existing v1.0 Oracle code remains fully valid:
- Statistical methods unchanged (fixed/random-effects, I², Q-test)
- Code syntax correct for R and Python
- Results interpretation remains accurate
- Pedagogical comments still helpful

**Optional Regeneration Benefits:**
1. **Datasets with >50% uncertain data (🔴 labels):**
   - Regenerate with v1.1 to get enhanced data quality warnings
   - Benefit from stronger caution statements in interpretation
   - Access improved sensitivity analysis code

2. **Multi-arm trial datasets:**
   - Regenerate with v1.1 to get multi-arm handling guidance
   - Receive warnings about correlated effect sizes
   - Access code for handling non-independence

3. **Very small datasets (k<3 studies):**
   - Regenerate with v1.1 to get appropriate warnings about low power
   - Simplified analysis approach (fixed-effect only)
   - Avoid unstable random-effects estimates

**When NOT to Regenerate:**
- Analysis already completed and published (preserve exact reproducibility)
- Dataset has good quality (mostly 🟢 labels, ≥5 studies, moderate heterogeneity)
- v1.0 code executed successfully with interpretable results

---

### Backwards Compatibility

**Fully Compatible:**
- ✅ v1.1 accepts same input CSV as v1.0 (Compiled Dataset Schema v1.0)
- ✅ Statistical methods unchanged (same formulas, same results for same data)
- ✅ Code structure unchanged (R and Python scripts self-contained)
- ✅ Generated code from v1.0 remains valid and executable
- ✅ No re-analysis required for existing Oracle outputs

**New Optional Input Fields (Handled Gracefully):**
- `multi_arm_trial` (from Microscope v1.1): If present → used for validation; if missing → ignored
- `multi_arm_details` (from Microscope v1.1): If present → mentioned in comments; if missing → ignored

**Version Identification:**
- v1.0 analyses: Comments include "Oracle v1.0"
- v1.1 analyses: Comments include "Oracle v1.1" plus enhanced validation notes
- Both versions produce statistically equivalent results for same datasets

---

### Known Limitations (Unchanged from v1.0)

   - Recommendation: Use specialized tools (brms, rstan) for Bayesian analyses

2. **Single effect size per study:** Assumes one effect per study (or pre-averaged)
   - Multi-level meta-analysis not directly supported
   - Recommendation: Use metafor with `rma.mv()` for nested structures

3. **Continuous moderators:** Subgroup analysis supports categorical variables only
   - Meta-regression (continuous predictors) not implemented
   - Recommendation: Manual meta-regression code or use metafor directly

4. **Publication bias detection:** Forest plots generated but no formal bias tests
   - Trim-and-fill, Egger's test, funnel plots not included
   - Recommendation: Use specialized bias detection packages

5. **Advanced heterogeneity diagnostics:** Q-test and I² provided

- Appropriate when: homogeneous populations, small number of studies
- Output: Pooled effect, SE, CI, Z-test p-value

**Random-Effects Model (DerSimonian-Laird):**
- τ² estimation: moment method (Q-based)
- Formula: τ² = max(0, (Q - (k-1)) / (Σw_i - Σw_i²/Σw_i))
- Appropriate when: heterogeneous effects, realistic scenario
- Output: Pooled effect, SE, CI, τ², I² heterogeneity

**Heterogeneity Assessment:**
- Q-statistic (chi-square test): DF = k-1, H₀: homogeneous
- I² index: max(0, (Q-(k-1))/Q × 100) with interpretation thresholds
- τ² (between-study variance): SD of true effects across studies

**Subgroup Analysis:**
- Stratified analysis: separate RE model per subgroup

- Identify effect size changes >10% (sensitivity indicator)
- Recommendations based on consistency of results

**Interpretation Guidance:**

**Effect Size Magnitude (Cohen's d scale):**
- Small: |d| < 0.5
- Medium: 0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8
- Large: |d| ≥ 0.8

**Heterogeneity (I² index):**
- Low: I² < 25%
- Moderate: 25% ≤ I² < 50%
- Substantial: 50% ≤ I² < 75%
- Considerable: I² ≥ 75%

**Data Quality Thresholds:**
- ≤20% uncertain (🟡+🔴): High quality, robust analysis
- 20-40% uncertain: Mixed quality, use sensitivity analysis
- >40% uncertain: Low quality, interpret cautiously

**Documentation:**

### Known Limitations

1. **Frequentist only:** Oracle v1.0 focuses on frequentist inference (fixed/random effects, Q-tests, I²)
   - Bayesian meta-analysis planned for v2.0
   - Recommendation: Use specialized Bayesian packages (brms, stan) for Bayesian analyses

2. **Single effect size per study:** Assumes one effect size row per study (merged or averaged)
   - Multi-level meta-analysis not directly supported
   - Recommendation: Use mixed-effects meta-regression for nested structures

3. **Continuous moderators:** Subgroup analysis supports categorical variables
   - Meta-regression (continuous x) not implemented in v1.0
   - Recommendation: Manual meta-regression code (linear model with weights)

4. **Publication bias detection:** Forest plots generated but no formal funnel plot or bias tests
   - Trim-and-fill, Egger's test planned for v2.0
   - Recommendation: Manual inspection or specialized tools (metatrim, multcomp)

5. **Advanced heterogeneity diagnostics:** Q-test and I² provided
   - Higgins-Thompson, Doi-Baujat plots not included
   - Recommendation: Use metafor package directly for advanced diagnostics

6. **Effect size transformations:** Limited to log-transformation for ratios
   - Other transformations (Fisher's Z for correlations) require manual adjustment
   - Recommendation: Pre-process effect sizes before compilation if non-standard metrics needed

### Migration Notes

**From manual statistical analysis:**
- Review your existing meta-analysis code against Oracle outputs
- Ensure random-effects model uses DerSimonian-Laird τ² (standard practice)
- Verify effect size scales match (log-transformed ratios must be log in compiled dataset)

**From other meta-analysis tools:**
- Oracle assumes Compiled Dataset Schema v1.0 format
- If data from different source, validate column names and effect size coding
- Check UTF-8 encoding for emoji labels (🟢/🟡/🔴)

**Reproducibility:**
- Save all Oracle-generated scripts for archival
- Document version: "Analysis conducted using MAestro Oracle v1.0"
- Include script code in supplementary materials (OSF, GitHub, etc.)
