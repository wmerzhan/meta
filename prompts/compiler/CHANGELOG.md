## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-24

### Summary

Version 1.1.0 introduces quality-of-life improvements to Compiler based on Story 3.6 post-beta refinements. While beta testing revealed NO critical issues with Compiler v1.0 (7 testers across 91 papers reported 0 compiler-specific failures), this release adds proactive enhancements to improve data quality detection, validation guidance, and multi-arm trial handling.

**Key Improvements:**
- Pre-compilation validation checklist to catch data card issues before aggregation
- Enhanced data card validation with screening decision handling
- Improved multi-row study handling guidance for complex designs
- Multi-arm trial detection in data quality summary
- Updated compiler version field to v1.1

**Backwards Compatibility:** v1.1 outputs remain fully compatible with Oracle v1.0+ and all downstream analysis tools. No breaking changes to CSV schema or three-color labeling system.

---

### Added

#### Pre-Compilation Validation Checklist (NEW)
- **Data card structure validation** before compilation begins:
  - YAML frontmatter syntax check (valid YAML, required fields present)
  - Markdown table format verification (pipe-delimited, consistent columns)
  - Three-color label presence check (üü¢üü°üî¥ emoji in source columns)
  - Required field completeness (study_id, authors, year, effect_size)
- **Screening decision handling:**
  - Skip data cards with `screening_decision: "exclude"` to save context
  - Report skipped cards in compilation summary
  - Document exclusion reasons in error log
- **Early error detection:**
  - Flag malformed YAML before attempting compilation
  - Identify missing source labels and assign üî¥ preemptively
  - Detect duplicate study_ids and prepare suffix strategy (_v2, _v3)
- **Benefits:** Prevents compilation failures mid-process; provides clear error messages upfront

#### Enhanced Data Card Validation
- **Screening decision field processing:**
  - Extract `screening_decision` from YAML frontmatter
  - If "exclude" ‚Üí skip data card, document reason, continue with next card
  - If "include" ‚Üí proceed with full extraction and mapping
  - If missing ‚Üí assume "include" but log warning
- **Multi-arm trial field recognition:**
  - Detect `multi_arm_trial: true` in YAML frontmatter (new in Microscope v1.1)
  - Extract `multi_arm_details` field if present
  - Flag multi-arm studies in data quality summary
  - Validate that multi-arm studies have multiple effect size rows
- **Quality score robustness:**
  - Handle both numeric (0-1 scale) and categorical ("high"/"medium"/"low") quality scores
  - Provide consistent mapping to 0-1 scale for analysis compatibility
  - Document mapping strategy in compilation notes

#### Improved Multi-Row Study Handling Guidance
- **Complex design detection:**
  - Multi-outcome studies (multiple outcomes per study)
  - Multi-timepoint studies (baseline, post-test, follow-up)
  - Multi-arm trials (multiple intervention arms vs. control)
  - Multi-site trials (site-level heterogeneity)
- **Row generation logic:**
  - Create ONE row per effect size (1 outcome √ó 1 timepoint √ó 1 comparison)
  - Use consistent `study_id` across all rows for same study
  - Add optional `outcome_measure` and `outcome_timepoint` columns for differentiation
  - Preserve source labels individually per row
- **Example guidance:**
  - Study with 3 outcomes ‚Üí 3 CSV rows (same study_id, different outcome_measure)
  - Multi-arm trial (2 interventions vs. control) ‚Üí 2 CSV rows (same study_id, different effect sizes)
  - Multi-timepoint study (post-test + 6-month follow-up) ‚Üí 2 CSV rows (same study_id, different outcome_timepoint)

#### Multi-Arm Trial Detection in Data Quality Summary
- **New quality metric:** Multi-arm trial count and percentage
  - Count studies with `multi_arm_trial: true` in YAML
  - Report in data quality summary: "Multi-Arm Trials: N (X%)"
  - List specific multi-arm studies for review
- **Validation checks for multi-arm designs:**
  - Verify multi-arm studies have ‚â•2 effect size rows (expected pairwise comparisons)
  - Flag single-row multi-arm studies as potential extraction errors
  - Document multi-arm details in compilation notes
- **Analysis readiness flag:**
  - If >20% of studies are multi-arm ‚Üí recommend subgroup analysis by comparison type
  - If multi-arm trial reporting inconsistent ‚Üí flag for manual review

#### Updated Compiler Version Field
- **Version identifier:** Update `compiler_version` column from "compiler_v1.0" to "compiler_v1.1"
- **Backwards compatible:** Mixed-version compilations supported (can combine v1.0 and v1.1 compilations)
- **Version tracking:** Document which compiler version used for reproducibility

---

### Enhanced

#### Data Quality Summary Enhancements
- **Label distribution:** Added percentage calculations and visual summary
  - üü¢ GREEN: N (X%) - Direct observations
  - üü° YELLOW: N (X%) - Computed values
  - üî¥ RED: N (X%) - Uncertain/missing data
- **High-uncertainty study identification:**
  - Enhanced threshold logic: Flag studies with >30% üî¥ labels OR ‚â•3 üî¥ data points
  - Rank high-uncertainty studies by üî¥ percentage for prioritized review
  - Provide specific field-level breakdown (which fields are üî¥?)
- **Multi-arm trial summary:**
  - Count and list multi-arm studies
  - Verify expected row counts (multi-arm should have multiple rows)
  - Flag inconsistencies for review
- **Data completeness metrics:**
  - Enhanced missing data reporting by field type
  - Calculate completeness percentage per required field
  - Identify systematic missing data patterns (e.g., all studies missing SE)

#### Error Handling Improvements
- **Field-level error messages:**
  - Instead of "Validation failed" ‚Üí "Sample size field missing in study_123 (check Methods section)"
  - Include remediation guidance in error log
  - Reference specific data card file and section
- **Graceful degradation:**
  - Best-effort parsing for malformed tables (attempt to extract partial data)
  - Document what was extracted vs. what failed in error log
  - Continue compilation with remaining data cards
- **Duplicate study_id handling:**
  - Enhanced suffix strategy: Append _v2, _v3, etc. automatically
  - Log original and renamed study_id for traceability
  - Document reason for duplication if discernible

#### Validation Checklist Enhancements
- **Pre-compilation checks:**
  - Verify all input data card files are accessible
  - Confirm YAML frontmatter is parseable
  - Check for required fields in at least 80% of cards (flag systematic issues)
  - Validate three-color label presence in effect size tables
- **Post-compilation checks:**
  - Verify output CSV has correct column count
  - Confirm all rows have valid study_id, authors, year
  - Check source_color_label column contains only üü¢üü°üî¥ emoji
  - Validate effect size transformations (dichotomous ratios log-transformed)
  - Test CSV import in R and Python (UTF-8 encoding verification)

---

### Fixed

#### Edge Case Handling
- **Screening decision edge case:** Handle missing `screening_decision` field gracefully (assume "include" with warning)
- **Multi-arm trial single-row detection:** Flag multi-arm trials with only 1 row as potential extraction error
- **Quality score format variation:** Handle both "high"/"medium"/"low" text and 0-1 numeric scores
- **CI bounds order validation:** Detect and swap inverted CI bounds (lower > upper) with documentation

---

### Context: Beta Testing Feedback Assessment

**Beta Study Summary:**
- **Testers:** 7 researchers across 5 disciplines
- **Papers Tested:** 91 total (21 gold standards)
- **Testing Period:** 6 weeks (October 28 - December 6, 2025)
- **Compiler-Specific Issues Reported:** 0 critical, 0 major, 2 minor feature requests

**Feedback Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **CSV output format:** Universally accepted by testers (R and Python users)
- ‚úÖ **Three-color label preservation:** No fidelity issues reported
- ‚úÖ **Aggregation logic:** No complaints about data mapping or transformations
- ‚úÖ **Context handling:** 4-12 data cards compiled successfully without issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature requests:**
  1. Pre-compilation validation checklist (ADDED in v1.1)
  2. Multi-arm trial detection (ADDED in v1.1)

**Compiler Performance Metrics (Beta Testing):**

- Beta feedback aggregation: `tests/validation/3.6_beta_feedback_aggregation.md`
- Story 3.6 completion summary: `tests/validation/3.6_story_completion_summary.md`

---

### Non-Changes (What Stayed the Same)

These core components remain unchanged from v1.0:

- **Input format:** Data Card Template v1.0 structure (YAML + markdown tables)
- **Output schema:** Compiled Dataset Schema v1.0 (all columns, data types, formats)
- **Three-color label preservation:** üü¢üü°üî¥ emoji extraction and fidelity rules
- **Effect size transformations:** Dichotomous ratio log-transformation logic
- **Quality score mapping:** 0-1 scale normalization approach
- **Missing value conventions:** Empty strings/cells (no "NA" text)
- **Error logging format:** Markdown error log structure
- **Context window management:** Batch processing guidance for >20 cards

**Rationale:** Compiler v1.0 received zero critical or major feedback items during beta testing. v1.1 additions focus on enhancing what already works rather than fixing broken functionality. Conservative enhancement approach maintains reliability while adding value.

---

### Migration Guide: v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1

#### For New Compilations (Recommended Path)
**Use v1.1 for all new compilations.** Enhanced validation prevents errors and saves troubleshooting time:
- Pre-compilation checklist catches issues before aggregation
- Multi-arm trial detection ensures complete data extraction
- Enhanced error messages make troubleshooting faster

#### For Existing v1.0 Compilations (No Action Required)

**No re-compilation needed.** Existing v1.0 compiled datasets remain fully valid:
- Compatible with Oracle v1.0+ (no schema changes)
- Compatible with all analysis tools (R, Python, Excel, SPSS)
- Three-color labels preserved correctly
- Effect size transformations correct

**Optional Re-Compilation Benefits:**
1. **Multi-arm trial datasets:**
   - Re-compile with v1.1 to get multi-arm detection in data quality summary
   - Verify all pairwise comparisons are present
   - Check multi-arm trial field consistency

2. **Large datasets (>20 cards):**
   - Re-compile with v1.1 to benefit from enhanced error logging
   - Improved validation may catch edge cases missed in v1.0

3. **Datasets with excluded studies:**
   - Re-compile with v1.1 to properly handle screening decisions
   - Excluded data cards will be skipped automatically

**When NOT to Re-Compile:**
- Small, simple datasets (<10 studies, no multi-arm trials)
- Datasets already analyzed and published (preserve exact reproducibility)
- v1.0 compilation had no errors or warnings

---

### Backwards Compatibility

**Fully Compatible:**
- ‚úÖ v1.1 compiled CSVs work with Oracle v1.0+ (schema unchanged)
- ‚úÖ v1.1 accepts v1.0 AND v1.1 Microscope data cards (handles both)
- ‚úÖ Three-color labeling system unchanged (üü¢üü°üî¥ definitions identical)
- ‚úÖ Column order and data types unchanged (CSV schema v1.0 maintained)
- ‚úÖ Existing v1.0 compiled datasets remain valid (no forced re-compilation)

**New Optional Processing:**
- `screening_decision` field: If present ‚Üí respected; if missing ‚Üí ignored (assume "include")
- `multi_arm_trial` field: If present ‚Üí reported in quality summary; if missing ‚Üí ignored
- `multi_arm_details` field: If present ‚Üí included in notes; if missing ‚Üí left blank

**Version Identification:**
- v1.0 compilations: `compiler_version: "compiler_v1.0"` column
- v1.1 compilations: `compiler_version: "compiler_v1.1"` column
- Mixed-version datasets supported (can combine v1.0 and v1.1 compilations in meta-analysis)

---

### Known Limitations (Unchanged from v1.0)

1. **Context window:** Validated with 4-20 data cards per batch
   - Theoretical limit: ~20-30 cards per compilation
   - Recommendation: Use batch processing for >50 cards

2. **Complex multi-outcome studies:** Handles basic multi-row scenarios
   - Extreme heterogeneity (10+ outcomes per study) may require manual review

3. **Custom quality checklists:** Quality score mapping assumes generic or ROB2 structure
   - Custom checklists may need adjusted mapping logic (document in compilation notes)
