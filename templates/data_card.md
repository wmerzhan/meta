MARKDOWN BODY: EXTRACTED DATA WITH SOURCE LABELS
=============================================================================

This section contains the actual research data extracted from the paper.
All data points MUST include source labels using the three-color system.

THREE-COLOR SOURCE LABELING SYSTEM:
This labeling system ensures transparency and traceability of all extracted data.

游릭 GREEN - Direct Quote/Observation
   - Data taken directly from the paper without interpretation
   - Always include: page number and section reference
   - Example: "Sample size n=42 (p. 7, Methods section)"
   - Use for: directly reported statistics, exact quotes, tables from paper

游리 YELLOW - Computed/Inferred Value
   - Data calculated or inferred from information in the paper
   - Always include: calculation formula or reasoning process
   - Always include: page numbers of source data used in calculation
   - Example: "Mean age 35.2 years (calculated as weighted average from
              Table 2 groups: [30*20 + 40*22]/42, p. 8)"
   - Use for: computed effect sizes, derived statistics, aggregated values

游댮 RED - Uncertain/Missing Data
   - Data not clearly reported, ambiguous, or completely missing
   - Always include: explanation of what's uncertain or missing
   - Always include: impact on analysis if relevant
   - Example: "Control group size not reported; unable to calculate
              between-group effect size"
   - Use for: missing data, contradictory information, unclear reporting

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Every data point must have a label (游릭/游리/游댮)
2. Every label must have evidence (page/section/calculation/explanation)
3. When in doubt, use 游댮 and explain the uncertainty
4. Labels ensure academic credibility and allow uncertainty quantification

# Participant Demographics

<!--
Table for population characteristics. Include source labels for all values.
Rows can be added/removed based on study design.
-->

| Variable | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Total sample size (N) | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Intervention group (n) | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Control group (n) | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

| Population description | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Inclusion criteria | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Exclusion criteria | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

<!-- Add additional demographic variables as needed for your meta-analysis -->

# Study Design

<!--
Table for study design characteristics. Essential for quality assessment
and subgroup analysis.
-->

| Design Element | Description | Source Label & Evidence |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Study design type | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Intervention description | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Control/comparison description | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

| Randomization method | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Blinding | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Setting | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

# Outcomes and Measures

<!--
Table for outcome variables and measurement instruments.
Add rows for each outcome measured in the study.
-->

| Outcome Variable | Measurement Instrument | Reliability/Validity | Time Point | Source Label & Evidence |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Primary outcome 1 | | | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Secondary outcome 1 | | | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Secondary outcome 2 | | | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

<!-- Add additional outcome rows as needed -->

---

# Effect Sizes

<!--
Table for effect size data. This is often the core data for meta-analysis.
Each row should represent one comparison for one outcome.

IMPORTANT: Effect sizes often require calculation (游리) when papers only
report means, SDs, and sample sizes. Always show your calculation.
-->

| Outcome | Comparison | Effect Size Type | Value | SE | 95% CI Lower | 95% CI Upper | Source Label & Evidence |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------|----|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| | | Cohen's d / OR / r | | | | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

<!--
Effect size calculation examples:

游리 Cohen's d calculation from means and SDs:
   d = (M1 - M2) / SD_pooled
   where SD_pooled = sqrt(((n1-1)*SD1^2 + (n2-1)*SD2^2) / (n1+n2-2))

   Example: "d = (5.2 - 4.1) / 1.85 = 0.59
            [calculated from Table 3, p. 12: M_int=5.2, SD_int=1.8, n_int=42;
             M_ctrl=4.1, SD_ctrl=1.9, n_ctrl=38]"

游리 Standard error calculation:
   SE = sqrt((n1+n2)/(n1*n2) + d^2/(2*(n1+n2)))

游릭 Directly reported effect size:
   "r = 0.42, 95% CI [0.28, 0.56] (Table 4, p. 15)"

游댮 Missing data for effect size:
   "Means reported without SDs or CIs; cannot calculate effect size (Results, p. 10)"
-->

# Attrition and Missing Data

<!--
Document sample attrition and missing data patterns.
Critical for quality assessment and sensitivity analysis.
-->

| Measure | Value | Source Label & Evidence |
|---------|-------|------------------------|
| Initial sample size | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Final sample size | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Attrition rate (%) | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Reasons for attrition | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |
| Missing data handling | | 游릭/游리/游댮 |

# Quality Assessment Details

<!--
This section elaborates on the quality_scores in the YAML frontmatter.
Provide justification for each quality rating based on extracted information.

Format depends on the quality checklist module used (generic, ROB2, etc.).
-->

**Overall Quality Rating:**

**Domain-Specific Assessments:**

1. **[Domain 1 Name]:** [Rating]
   - Justification: [Reference specific information from paper with source label]

2. **[Domain 2 Name]:** [Rating]
   - Justification: [Reference specific information from paper with source label]

<!-- Add additional quality domains based on your checklist -->
